SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY 

UPVOTE AND SHARE 

In the last hour of trading, some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

A) They have to pay interest on their short. Every day this continues it costs them more and more money just to continue to stay in the ring.

B) The PRICE is the price that the last share sold for. Stop worrying about it. Instead, look at the volumes. If their only game plan is to ""tank the price"" by selling a trickle of of shares then theyre just making their situation worse and that's what has been happening. The share price goes down on just a handful of shares and are quickly scooped back up. The short is still going to be a huge % of the float.

C) They're being investigated right now. Expect them to run out of dirty tricks soon.

So yes, their main play now is to make us bored and move on. The thing is that costs them money. If shareholders don't get bored and continue to hold then the GME short squeeze will happen.

1) GME closed above 320 today, meaning that calls are going to expire ITM and be exercised. This reduces the number of shares available, which is good for retail investors because it creates more pressure on short sellers.

2) The squeeze that is expected to happen next week is the result of people buying and holding shares of GME. Short sellers will be forced to buy shares at a higher cost than they sold them for.

3) The longer short sellers wait to buy shares, the more interest they have to pay, thus increasing their pressure to buy.

4) Theoretically, if the price of GME continues going up, short sellers will be forced to buy shares at increasingly higher prices, which will further drive the stock price up, thus creating a feedback loop.",2021-01-29 22:15:44

974,974,glajzho,1611984136.0,"This to consider moving forward:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the GME explosion, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME.

3. Robinhood, Webull, etc. are trying to point fingers all over the place as though they don't share blame in anything. But YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were. That's grotesquely and blatantly market manipulation. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. If even 1k of us did that, that's a major ad revenue / data loss for Google.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees. This matters.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY 

UPVOTE AND SHARE 

In the last hour of trading, some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all. 

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

HOLD YOUR AMC SHARES UNTIL AT LEAST $200 A SHARE. THE LONGER WE HOLD, THE HARDER THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. AT 200 WE WILL DECIDE IF WE HOLD AND PUSH FOR HIGHER NUMBERS OR IF WE SETTLE (MOST LIKELY WE WILL HOLD FOR MORE). Remember, the longer we hold, the more the hedge fund bastards will have to pay in fees. We will rinse them out.

HOLD YOUR AMC. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HEDGE'S SCARE TACTICS. THEY WILL SHORT LADDER, PASS FAKE NEWS, WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. WE WILL HOLD OUT. DIAMOND HANDS. SET YOUR SELL LIMITS TO 200. WE WILL SHOW JUST HOW STRONG WE ARE TOGETHER. 

This may take a few days. Maybe even a couple weeks. Just look at $GME. But we stand together, and we rise.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

It's tempting to look at the current stock price and think it may be a good time to take profits. But that was my mistake 2 days ago. I thought it was going to dip so I sold figuring I'd buy back in at the bottom. Learn from my mistake. It didn't dip. It kept climbing and I'd be up another 50k right now. There is no timing the dip. 💎✋💎✋💎✋All the way, the whole way, is the only way.

A lot of people are up a fat chunk of change right now and think ""they're good"" but there is an astronomical fucking megaton of life left in this. The rocket hasn't even gotten off of the launchpad yet. We still have another 384,000km to the moon and another 41627214079355.52 km to Alpha Centauri.

If you're not on board yet, here's the last call before we fire up the trusters.

This is not financial advice. I am not an advisor of finance. I don't even know what a finance is. My IQ is 4. Plz send help.

They are STILL borrowing shares to short. See how the number is decreasing! That means Short Float IS INCREASING (250% now)!

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

They can only even borrow 75,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun!

Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday. SHORTS HAVE NOT CLOSED!

NOTE: THE SUPPLY OF SHORT SHARES AVAILABLE IS GOING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING, YOU SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT

For those of you who are new and scared, we raised the floor of this stock by 100% today, which is OBSCENE, just stay the course.

I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK! 💎🙌🏻

( This is copied from a fellow redditor. I did not write this. This is not financial advice. Just do your research and make the best decisions for you.)

EDIT: This is a once in a lifetime event that they will never risk happening ever again.

Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME. Their shorts don't expire, naked shorting, 140$ short interest, their weekly and monthly expire on friday and all we need to do is hold onto our shares so that they can't have them and INFINITE SQUEEZE JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all.

HOLDING UNTIL $69420.00 PER SHARE. Fuck you Wall Street. We're taking our fucking money back

EDIT2: I don't know a day. I don't know how long it will go. I do know that there's nothing they can do, nowhere for them to go if we hold. Then we're gonna see the stock multiply suddenly by 5, by 10, by 100 and that's the moment we're going to be making some new money millionaires all over the country. Godspeed everyone.

Our fall? Who wishes it so? Robinhood?

No, Robinhood;  
If we are mark'd to lose tendies, we are enough  
To do our brothers loss; and if we are to get tendies,  
The fewer men, the greater share of honor.  
God's will! I pray thee, wish not for one paper hands more in our fight.

By Robinhood, I am not covetous for gold,  
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;  
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;  
Such outward things dwell not in my desires.

But if it be a sin to covet HONOR,  
I am the most offending soul alive 💎🙌💎🙌.

No, faith, my bros, wish not a man from the middle class.  
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honor  
As one man more methinks would share from me  
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!  
Rather proclaim it, Robinhood, through my host,  
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,  
Let him depart; his passport shall be made,  
And crowns for convoy put into his purse;  
We would not lose tendies in that man's company  
That fears his fellowship to lose tendies with us 💎🙌.

This day is call'd the feast of $GME.  
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,  
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,  
And rouse him at the name of $GME.  
He that shall live this day, and see old age,  
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,  
And say ""To-morrow is $GME.""  
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,  
And say ""These wounds I had on $GME day.""

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,  
But he'll remember, with advantages,  
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,  
Familiar in his mouth as household words—  
Chamath, Elon, DFV, Warren, AOC the Gamestop Bunny—  
Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.

**This story shall the good man teach his son;**  
**And $GME day shall ne'er go by,**  
**From this day to the ending of the world,**  
**But we in it shall be rememberèd—**  
**We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;**  
**For he to-day that sheds his blood with me**  
**Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,**  
**This day shall gentle his condition;**  
**And gentlemen in WSB now a-bed**  
**Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,**  
**And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks**  
**That fought with us upon $GME day.** 💎🙌🚀",2021-01-28 17:16:15

I have to admit at first I thought these bastards were going to get away with painting us as evil, conniving, soulless degenerates (well, that part we are) hell bent on robbing the public's money.

BUT I'm overwhelmed by the public display of support for us AND the denouncement of these Wallstreet criminals.

The world's richest man Tweeted for us. TWICE.

Politicians openly demand a review of Wallstreet.

A famous pornstar gave us direction and inspiration as we were being silenced.

People from Germany, Korea, Canada, everywhere are throwing their support! World wide unity for a single cause!

JA FUCKING RULE entered the chat! JA RULE!

I'm not an emotional person, and I do have a position in GME (for disclosure) but it truly is uplifting to see that we are not being swept away, we are being LENT a voice, we are being given an instrument to fight back.

When the price plummeted, dread set in. I thought to myself, REALLY? THEY ARE GOING TO WIN? THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY HOPE FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. Like darkness was descending, the walls were falling, and Wallstreet was coming in to finish us off. And the a dim light appeared. Then another. And suddenly, we weren't just huddling in a corner, HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, because if this went tits up, many people were going to be SERIOUISLY, perhaps, irreversibly be ruined.

Chamath it said it. What side of history do you want to be on?

The side where billionaires live to see the day where their yachts and mansions and penthouses are untouched and millions of hardworking people are BANKRUPTED?

Or one where the little guy feasts for one night and maybe rescues their entire generation?

No matter how this ends, I wanted to let everyone here know (and anyone just standing on the sidelines too) that WE DID something special. 2020 was utter crap but it lead up to this.

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**🚀** **🚀🚀🚀** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

Which means, as soon as they open the GME and BB to buy again, the price will shoot back up. 

Also, regardless, this Friday there is a massive Gamma squeeze coming in.. so it will go above yesterday close for sure. 

Hold on to your pants... don’t be scared by the drops. The mathematics of a short squeeze don’t lie. The new shorts, mean an even higher price above our initial $1000 estimates. Those who hold will be rewarded. Fuck yeah! Lets go!

3556,3556,gl4mba4,1611888150.0,"Let me explain something to those of you here that are still trying to figure out what is going on. Wall street is trying to break the rules because retail played fairly, and wall street lost. Is GME worth 200+ dollars? That's for you to decide based on your own value system. For me, there is a lot of value in knowing that having a few shares of this company is causing billionaires and hedge funds to suffer. These people that have juiced our economy for so long with their greed and corruption. 

So what are they doing? They are preventing people from trading while they trade as much as they want to generate price action to get people to panic. They are doubling down on their belief that we are unsophisticated. They are appealing to the SEC to regulate us because they are on the verge of losing an incredible amount of wealth. 

There is a very real chance that if you buy a share today you might lose all that you put into it. But let me ask you this: Is losing $200 worth making these people suffer for the blatant and obvious corrupt behavior they are showing us as I type this? If you can't afford to lose $200 you absolutely should not buy GME. Frankly, I am not a financial advisor of any sort, so if you listen to me you might be an idiot. I'm just another millenial that was raised believing the world was full of opportunity, but even with a degree and full time job in my field I spend 50% of my income on rent. ON RENT. I drive a piece of shit vehicle with 160000 miles on it. I sold 20 of my shares yesterday (don't worry I bought them back on the dip today) and I now have more disposable income that I have ever had in my entire life. 

These people would rather die than let you have any of their money. I am fully prepared to lose everything I have put into GME, and you know what? I will still have more disposable income than ever before because I flipped a quick trade on GME. I am lucky that I was using a broker that let me. If you are still on the fence of whether to buy...well, make your own decision. Do your own due diligence. However, this moment we are witnessing is going to be taught by shitty high school baseball coaches in econ class for decades to come. No matter what happens here, wall street is losing.

The Great Recession of ’08 turned my life inside-out. I lived with my single mother, who was a small business owner and part-time dental hygienist, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Even through the chemotherapy, she continued to bust her ass to keep us from going under. She was fired from her part-time job for having cancer, and was struggling to keep up with the mortgage, car payment, medical bills, etc. My mother died in October of 2009 and the business, the house, everything went along with her.

My mother did not get bailed out. I did not get bailed out. You and your parents did not get bailed out. You know who did? Wall Street. And on our dime. These hedge funds, like Melvin Capital Management LP, continue to manipulate and exploit the working Americans like you and me, and they do so with relative impunity.

What happens when retail investors observe and discuss this phenomenon openly, sharing their own due diligence and research on these companies, forming their own opinions on how to underwrite securities?

3825,3825,gl66e04,1611909846.0,"For those confused what this chart means, this is the options chain for all BB options that expire tomorrow (1/29). Look at the Open Interest (OI) column, this indicates the total number of option contracts that are held by investors in active positions. The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

One potential good catalyst is if GME / AMC resolves and people take profits, people here will want something to roll their profits into.  BB is one of the stocks on WSB and can be seen as a lot more stable, so it might be a boon for all of us.

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

5823,5823,gle87q2,1612061703.0,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

These moves limiting trading aren't so much to help the smaller hedge funds with underwater shorts. They are trying to drive price down because if the shorts end up insolvent they will be unable to by back and return shares. Many of these shares have been loaned out by brokers like Robinhood.

The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings?

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. **Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted.** Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS.

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades)

But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up

But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds)


Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed

They can only do this so much before that would also make them run out of money. They are on the ropes, desperate, they dont want to lose their million dollar wives lol

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest",2021-01-30 14:46:25

7172,7172,gl20jv3,1611842040.0,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

Thank you RK for your initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world.

Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under?

I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing.

If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry.

GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality.

People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.

Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.

GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?

Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.

I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.

Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.

7608,7608,gl5jzzt,1611900327.0,"**Melvin Capital lost tremendous amounts of money due to over-extended shorting of Gamestock (GME) stock. Retail investors discovered this and began buying the security to leverage against their position. Melvin Capital was granted close to 2.7 billion dollars in loans by Citadel Securities, LLC (investment firm) for liquidity.**

**Citadel Securities (market maker) processes ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL, LLC’s transactions. To prevent further losses, they potentially pressured Robinhood to restrict buying of specific stocks such as GME, AMC, NOK, and others by retail investors. As of 1/28, GME is specifically blocked from being bought on Robinhood - an unprecedented event following no actual SEC rules or Robinhood terms and conditions.**

**Other retail trading sites continue to allow trades - this is Robinhood specifically curtailing market action, likely under specific pressure from Citadel and Citadel Securities.**
**Note that although they are separate corporate entities, Citadel and Citadel Securities are owned by the same individual - Ken Griffin.**

**These companies seem to be colluding behind the scenes to block legitimate investment actions by individuals, to their own profit. Their communications may reveal this manipulation.**

**Thus:**
**We make the argument that Robinhood Financial, LLC in coordination with Citadel Securites, LLC and Melvin Capital Management, LP willfully engaged in market manipulation by restricting buying power of the security GME by actionably preventing its users from exercising their financial leverage to cover their position. This has resulted in immeasurable losses to millions of users unable to trade the security in a way that is financially in their best interest according to their own belief.**

**Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security.**",2021-01-28 23:05:27

They had a guest and a interview clip, and the FINAL POINT WAS THAT THEY'RE NOT SURE IF ANY THING ILLEGAL HAPPENED... BUT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATING OF MARKET MANIPULATION BY REDDIT! THAT WE CAN SHARE OPINION BUT NOT BAND TOGETHER OR SHARE FALSE INFORMATION. (SOUND FAMILIAR CNBC?!)

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more.

7891,7891,gle87q2,1612061703.0,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no.

That $2.75 billion is going to probably come at us in a myriad of terrifying ways today and the primary way might be through wash trades where it LOOKS like your fellow WSB tards are selling.  This wash trading is illegal as fuck, but I don’t think that will matter at this point.

This equation is simple.  Supply and demand.

There are only two ways we die on the GME hill:

1.  Paper handed cowards sell them GME for less than $1,000 after they fall for the scare tactics.

2.  GME management sells them treasury stock in an off exchange transaction like what Elon did in December.

The moral of the story is:  HOLD and do not sell until GME is $1,000.  If there is no stock for sale under $1,000, they can’t buy shares for under $1,000.

8043,8043,gktmyz0,1611698081.0,"THINGS U CAN DO TO HELP THE SQUEEZE

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

May we print tendies and may the power of WSB💎👐🏽 empower us all to not 📃👐🏽.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

From a comment below: Ok, retards, GME General here. Listen up, because this is important.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.",2021-01-26 14:03:03
8332,8332,gku4ewo,1611706421.0,"To tie up all available shares:  Set active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. Set the good till date good till cancel. Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

I don’t have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this, it may not be the first time you’re seeing it but I am sending it to reach as many as I can.

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise.

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses.

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. When studying history (at some point we’ve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions.

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in.

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals? Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around.

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society.

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings.

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‘work culture’ that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable.

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it.

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over.

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

**Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!**

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the fund that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

**READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!**

**EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!**

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is **""Days to Cover""** or **""Short Ratio""** .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? **You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""**

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, **it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.**

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning **if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!** So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. **No need to panic sell.** No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the **short ratio.** If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, **NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? **$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.** If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

There are a lot of rumours out there and after researching a lot I will do my best to share my opinion on the situation and my plan. Please read.

Current Context

As of few days ago, there are still 60 million+ shorted stocks. This means that millions of stocks are shorted NAKED (no one lend them the stock to sell it (short it), which is only legal under very specific context).

📷

You must know that Melvin and other wales can hold their stock for long time BUT they are bleeding money with every day that passes.

If you learn one thing from this post, this should be it: There is no way they can close those 60 million. There are just not enough stocks available, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE POSITION.

The Stock price is irrelevant**, even at 17$** they are unable to close their position and IF WE HOLDthe squeeze inevitably will happen SOONER OR LATER

As of my math, retailers (like me) we own easy 20million + stock, and some wales in our side + owners are probably an extra 20 million stocks.

That makes the available float to be ~25 million. Do you understand how fucked they are now and why they need you to sell?

Melvin's and shorters gameplay

Taking those things into account, Melvin and other will try to make us believe that:

1.	⁠The short squeeze has already happened
2.	⁠Must happen today (Friday 29th) or wont happen
3.	⁠Show that is not possible because they keep pushing the price down and that makes the short squeeze impossible
4.	⁠Destroy your stamina and hope by raising and pushing the price down

None of that is true.

THINK!!! Many brokers have stopped allowing you to purchase because they are in heavy danger of being forced to close the position. None of this would have happened if we were not winning.

But when will the squeeze happen then?

When they are forced to close. And there are few things that will force their hand to close.

1.	⁠Margin call

•	⁠If the price raises too much they will be forced to close, regardless of what they want. Gamma squeeze (assigned call options at expiration + Market Makers forced to buy more and more stocks as the price raises to cover purchased calls) + BUYS and HOLD will keep reducing available stocks pushing the price UP. This will speed up by a lot a margin call forcing them to close. This can take days or few weeks, depending on how fast the price raises.

1.	⁠Liquidity call - Non payable interests

•	⁠Short positions must pay interest. They can hold their position if the price doesn't snow ball BUT they will keep loosing millions every time they have to pay interest. Don't get me wrong. If they can keep the price down we will need to wait several weeks or months before they run out of money.

What am I going to do in the next days / weeks / months

Pure and simple. BUY and HOLD.

Use dips to lower my average price. Keep removing float from the market and keep pushing pressure on the short positions.

Don't let anyone fool you. The squeeze will and can happen at any price. A high price will only make it happen sooner.

Do not sell. That is the only reason why a squeeze might not happen.

My Broker and my specific actions from EUROPE

My broker is IBKR. His owner (Thomas Peterffy) has admitted a crime on television, stating that he could not let the price snowball and that people is buying a stock that should be worth $17 at $300. This is market manipulation, raw and simple and he should go to jail.

I was not planning into risking more money but that has completely change now after yesterday 's global market manipulation.

I got my salary yesterday, and those 4k+ are going straight into GME. I have a new account with Ninety Nine that allows me to buy GME.

Please, understand that I do not recommend anyone to do this. I have a personal situation that allows me to hold the position for months and keep throwing money at it.

Do not follow my strategy 'cos you read it in a post in reddit. Be responsible about your financial situation, about what you think is going to happen and act accordingly.

Do not let your broker lend your stocks so other can short GME

IBKR and others will lend your stocks to other so they can short it but they cannot do this if you have an active order for your stocks.

I have a GTC - Fill ourside RTH - LIMIT SELL order at $15.000 to avoid this. It is fucking amazing how I need to keep setting this EVERY DAY. IBKR keeps cancelling it with the ""INVALID PRICE"" reason. What the fuck invalid price.

📷This is not anymore about money (for me)

They have done a fucking huge mistake. They have made a money matter a personal and rights matter and now I am pissed the fuck off. FUCK THE MONEY and the GAINS. I AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING SELL because IT IS MY FUCKING RIGHT.

HOLD, when it finally squeezes, sell on small %s (10%) at different price points, 4500, 8500, 11000, etc.

Understand this, the stock will go as high as necessary if we do not sell cheap (<XXXX). If there are no contracts there is no limit to the price the stock can reach.

8650,8650,gl8fdul,1611956645.0,"Guys, I’m seeing a lot of dumb shit. And not good dumb, bad dumb that could be fixed with 12 seconds on Google. The same amount of time it takes you to blow your load whilst being pegged by your wife’s boyfriend. So let’s sort this out and explain what’s actually happening today, maybe.

First, short squeeze. This happens when a bunch of short positions have to close quickly. There is no expiry date on a short position, so we don’t have foresight of when this will happen. People saying the shorts have to close today are lying, or dumb, or both. That doesn’t mean we won’t (or will) get a short squeeze today, for reasons I’ll explain below.

So, what *is* going to happen today? Fuck knows. But, there’s a Gamma squeeze potentially incoming. Gamma is complicated, and foreign, but the ELI5 version is that there are a bunch of ITM calls expiring today. Note that calls do expire, unlike shorts. Calls that are ITM can be *excercised*, which means taking up the *option* of buying the underlying stock. The calls expiring today are for tens of millions of shares. You don’t *have* to exercise your ITM call, and in fact some people will be unable to do so because they don’t have the money to do so. Entirely up to you, but if *I* had ITM calls expiring today I’d be doing my best to exercise because it’s the BDE power play, and I swing like that, even with a tiny pp.

So what does that mean for us? Well, potentially, over the next few trading days there’s going to be huge demand on the buy side from these ITM expiring calls being exercised. Huge demand might increase the price if the supply isn’t able to meet it.

Where do the shorts come in then? Hah, good question little buddy, good on you for not letting that missing chromosome keep you down. Whilst shorts don’t expire, the person who sold you that short wants to have confidence that you’re good for your end of the obligation (i.e. providing the number of shares you’ve shorted). If they don’t, they can *margin call* you, which will force you to close your position by buying shares at market rate. For retail investors, this is usually dependent on the size of your portfolio and your cash position. For institutional investors, it’s complicated, like your relationship with that boy scout leader who used to shower with you. The higher the price goes, the more margin calls are going to come in. More margin calls means more people buying. More people buying means price goes up. Price going up means more margin calls and potentially future ITM calls. Means more people buying, and so on. Short squeeze.

There are also people who bought puts (remember, three main ways to bet against a stock if you’re a 🌈 🐻 is to short, to sell calls, or to buy puts) who are just going to lose money and aren’t really moving the market in the same way other positions are.

Because of this, it’s difficult to predict when, or if, a short squeeze will happen. The signal will typically be large and increasing volume matched by rocketing share prize. The snowball effect should be noticeable. Also remember that if there’s a short squeeze, it can take *days* to fully play out.

Link your dumb friends to this so they don’t spam the thread with dumb ass questions. Apes together strong, but apes dumb alone.

Happy to take corrections from your mother once she’s read this out to you. Obviously this is describing the potential, and theory, we don’t know the true position when it comes to GME to predict when or if any of this is going to happen.",2021-01-29 14:44:05

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email.

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**🚀** **🚀🚀🚀** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

9325,9325,gl4mba4,1611888150.0,"Let me explain something to those of you here that are still trying to figure out what is going on. Wall street is trying to break the rules because retail played fairly, and wall street lost. Is GME worth 200+ dollars? That's for you to decide based on your own value system. For me, there is a lot of value in knowing that having a few shares of this company is causing billionaires and hedge funds to suffer. These people that have juiced our economy for so long with their greed and corruption. 

So what are they doing? They are preventing people from trading while they trade as much as they want to generate price action to get people to panic. They are doubling down on their belief that we are unsophisticated. They are appealing to the SEC to regulate us because they are on the verge of losing an incredible amount of wealth. 

There is a very real chance that if you buy a share today you might lose all that you put into it. But let me ask you this: Is losing $200 worth making these people suffer for the blatant and obvious corrupt behavior they are showing us as I type this? If you can't afford to lose $200 you absolutely should not buy GME. Frankly, I am not a financial advisor of any sort, so if you listen to me you might be an idiot. I'm just another millenial that was raised believing the world was full of opportunity, but even with a degree and full time job in my field I spend 50% of my income on rent. ON RENT. I drive a piece of shit vehicle with 160000 miles on it. I sold 20 of my shares yesterday (don't worry I bought them back on the dip today) and I now have more disposable income that I have ever had in my entire life. 

These people would rather die than let you have any of their money. I am fully prepared to lose everything I have put into GME, and you know what? I will still have more disposable income than ever before because I flipped a quick trade on GME. I am lucky that I was using a broker that let me. If you are still on the fence of whether to buy...well, make your own decision. Do your own due diligence. However, this moment we are witnessing is going to be taught by shitty high school baseball coaches in econ class for decades to come. No matter what happens here, wall street is losing.

The Great Recession of ’08 turned my life inside-out. I lived with my single mother, who was a small business owner and part-time dental hygienist, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Even through the chemotherapy, she continued to bust her ass to keep us from going under. She was fired from her part-time job for having cancer, and was struggling to keep up with the mortgage, car payment, medical bills, etc. My mother died in October of 2009 and the business, the house, everything went along with her.

My mother did not get bailed out. I did not get bailed out. You and your parents did not get bailed out. You know who did? Wall Street. And on our dime. These hedge funds, like Melvin Capital Management LP, continue to manipulate and exploit the working Americans like you and me, and they do so with relative impunity.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

They  fought like hell to hold the $150 line all day.  That was where they  drew the line in the sand.  Which tells us that that's the level at  which these guys were risking margin call.

The  news broke today that, in an effort to stem the bleeding, Melvin was  cutting his shorts with a battery maker and a pharma company (Vartas  and...I can't think of the other one) that were dragging him down....but  that he was keeping the GME shorts.

Probably out of a personal vendetta.

That 2.7 dollars he just got lifelined?  It's fucking gone.  It lasted one fucking day.

Which means, if we took him out....we probably took at least 1, probably 3 or 4, other smaller funds out with him.

What's this mean for them?  They've got about 17 hours to come up with a LOT of money.

What's it mean for us?  It's margin call for these guys, which means The Squeezening is Upon us.",2021-01-26 22:54:11

9708,9708,gl1ov2q,1611835441.0,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop",2021-01-27 04:05:38

2) Yes, hold your shares even when you see the stock dip like mad tomorrow - it's pretty much guaranteed to happen since the shorts will be dead if they allow the stock to remain at this price.

3) No, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and take the time to understand why this GME trade might be the best thing the world has seen since sliced bread.

As for me? All in on GME at 1281 shares. The fact that market makers are fighting so desperately to drop the share price should tell you that they're feeling the pressure.

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn’t just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called “smart money.” That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO 💎 🤲 AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

10467,10467,glbjia9,1612000347.0,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They  didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",2021-01-29 16:44:41

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

It's tempting to look at the current stock price and think it may be a good time to take profits. But that was my mistake 2 days ago.

There is no timing the dip. 💎✋💎✋💎✋All the way, the whole way, is the only way.

Personally I'm not going to suggest brokerages that did this when anyone asks for brokerage recommendations on here in the future. Not that I really recommended RH for ages anyways, but apparently going forward it's Fidelity and Etrade when people ask I guess.

You're talking about the head of the Nasdaq saying that trading in situations like GME should be paused so that pros can ""recalibrate?"" When my investments toilet, can I get a trade halt? 

As others have noted, this basically confirms a lot of what WSB have been saying. 

Is this some attempt for firms to try to ""protect"" people? Some people will end up losing big in this whole thing and that's unfortunate, but even if so, can't start stopping trading (what's the rules-based exact reason why RH is not allowing trading in these names?) because once you do it it's a slippery slope - what becomes, ""too much, gotta stop trading""?

I tell people on here that you're going to make mistakes and you have to learn from your errors and over time you hopefully evolve into a better investor. Apparently, when major funds make real mistakes, they don't have to learn from their mistakes, they yell for the ref to halt the game. When this GME squeeze is over (and it will be at some point - it isn't going to infinity), some people are going to be the bagholders and that's unfortunate but my question is, when GME reverses and there's volatility to the downside, will the same brokerages halt trading in these names again or no?

Whether you are for what WSB did or not, I think everyone can agree that this ""rules for me but not for thee.""  And maybe that's the way things are going to be and people have to adapt, but it's still pretty dismaying.

If this somehow shows how broken the system is (i don't think it's going to cause some sort of market crash, it will stop sooner than later), then that was going to happen eventually anyways.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced multiple stocks including NOK, AMC, BB, GME to be driven down after hours. Further more, searching the platform for ANY symbol has been disabled, and during critical periods the platform is unavailable. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

Robinhood has suddenly change the rules under the guise of ""protecting"" us when in reality they are directly affecting the outcomes of positions in which I and many others hold stake during a critical period, and by extension putting retail investors at heightened risk, and the only ones standing to benefit from this are the hedge funds with the most to lose on their short positions.

The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings?

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. **Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted.** Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS.

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades)

But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up

But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds)


Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no. If all I need to do is buy gme to stick it to these fucks then so be it. Buying 500 shares today.",2021-01-26 13:08:17

That $2.75 billion is going to probably come at us in a myriad of terrifying ways today and the primary way might be through wash trades where it LOOKS like your fellow WSB tards are selling.  This wash trading is illegal as fuck, but I don’t think that will matter at this point.

This equation is simple.  Supply and demand.

There are only two ways we die on the GME hill:

1.  Paper handed cowards sell them GME for less than $1,000 after they fall for the scare tactics.

2.  GME management sells them treasury stock in an off exchange transaction like what Elon did in December.

The moral of the story is:  HOLD and do not sell until GME is $1,000.  If there is no stock for sale under $1,000, they can’t buy shares for under $1,000.

12229,12229,gktmyz0,1611698081.0,"THINGS U CAN DO TO HELP THE SQUEEZE

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

May we print tendies and may the power of WSB💎👐🏽 empower us all to not 📃👐🏽.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

12749,12749,glbjtm9,1612000501.0,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it​",2021-01-30 02:55:01

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

You have five beautiful children, six cars, a dozen properties and three homes. You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation.

• We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

• The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

• WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Don't let them bully, scare, or manipulate you into selling for a PENNY less than what you COULD get at the highest point betwee now and 2030.

Melvin haven't closed out. This is a manipulation tactic to drive down prices, either to cover their losses, or they've made a put at $350. This is the dirtiest trick yet, so they must be desperate. If we smash through $350, they are probably done permanently.

There are also other shorts open, for taking which we don't focus on. They still need to be squashed.

All this does is present a last chance to get on the rocket if you haven't done so already.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don’t understand what’s going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

If you've watched any of DFV's youtube videos you can easily tell that the ridiculous short against gme is not the only reason he invested heavily into gamestop. He genuinely believes in the future if gamestop and he feels that they will definitely turn things around going forward, not only that but might even go onto becoming a solid institution by itself. He's done some solid research and has clearly predicted everything correctly. As the name suggests hes a VALUE investor which means he is absolutely not going to sell even if the price goes below 100 cuz hes in it for the long run.

14363,14363,glay021,1611990088.0,"Re: Gamestop

Fellow humans: This is more than a meme. This is more than a way to earn a quick dollar. This is more than a way to fuck over rich people. This is a social movement. This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.

What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.

What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us “amateur” traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids’ schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. 

What can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that “these reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.” That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. 

If you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT. I am not a financial advisor, I am not “smart” enough. I am just a concerned individual who likes the stock.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.

Heck... you might want to throw SPCE in there as they are also in the top 3 heaviest shorted stocks and they’re even about to go to space for real. AMC has to close out above $9 bare minimum, although I think it’ll soar tomorrow. If it closes above $9, options closing tomorrow cannot be covered/exercised/filled. Options for AMC over $9 do not exist. If you don’t know what any of this means, in short, this is what starts the actual short squeeze. And when it happens- the possibility of price target is truly astronomical, until it naturally ends. These short squeezes may end up being some of the biggest ones in history. Millionaires will be made over night. No joke. Sounds to good to be true, but it also only happens once in a blue moon. Buy and hold. Don’t buy all at once either. Buy small amounts of shares here and there as the price increases. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Don’t be surprised if this squeeze continues into next week all the way to Friday. $$$$$

(NOTE) Robinhood is getting taken down by everyone including Congress. People have to sell everything first to exit out of Robinhood tomorrow. We may even see a quick crash. Hold. Buy more. THEN, these people will be transferring money into another brokerage to trade. This will take 1-2 days. This is why more money will be pouring into GME, AMC, and maybe SPCE next week. Hold.

I am not a financial advisor i just spreading the information from others.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest",2021-01-31 09:30:12

You saved the hedge fund billionaires by adding restriction on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc and stand against your hard working community. 
The hedge fund managers had made tons of millions of money by shorting businesses and no one take any action, but why is it that the only one time that they are losing money,  you stand on the hedge fund side and made your own community suffer the loss. 
Robinhood it’s because of your action that today I lost $7K, I know for you it doesn’t look like a big amount but it is %45 of my whole life investment.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don’t forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I’ll see you on the moon 🚀 🌚

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

I don’t have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this, it may not be the first time you’re seeing it but I am sending it to reach as many as I can.

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise.

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses.

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. When studying history (at some point we’ve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions.

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in.

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals? Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around.

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society.

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings.

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‘work culture’ that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable.

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it.

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over.

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play.

Ignore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your 💎 🙌 I am not an investment manager, I am but a humble dumbass who really likes this stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-29 14:17:58

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

NOT SELLING.”

**Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!**

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the fund that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

**READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!**

**EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!**

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is **""Days to Cover""** or **""Short Ratio""** .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? **You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""**

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, **it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.**

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning **if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!** So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. **No need to panic sell.** No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the **short ratio.** If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, **NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? **$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.** If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

16152,16152,gl8xws4,1611963719.0,"Fellow Hodors, Spartans and retards,

There are a lot of rumours out there and after researching a lot I will do my best to share my opinion on the situation and my plan. Please read.

Current Context

As of few days ago, there are still 60 million+ shorted stocks. This means that millions of stocks are shorted NAKED (no one lend them the stock to sell it (short it), which is only legal under very specific context).

📷

You must know that Melvin and other wales can hold their stock for long time BUT they are bleeding money with every day that passes.

If you learn one thing from this post, this should be it: There is no way they can close those 60 million. There are just not enough stocks available, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE POSITION.

The Stock price is irrelevant**, even at 17$** they are unable to close their position and IF WE HOLDthe squeeze inevitably will happen SOONER OR LATER

As of my math, retailers (like me) we own easy 20million + stock, and some wales in our side + owners are probably an extra 20 million stocks.

That makes the available float to be ~25 million. Do you understand how fucked they are now and why they need you to sell?

Melvin's and shorters gameplay

Taking those things into account, Melvin and other will try to make us believe that:

1.	⁠The short squeeze has already happened
2.	⁠Must happen today (Friday 29th) or wont happen
3.	⁠Show that is not possible because they keep pushing the price down and that makes the short squeeze impossible
4.	⁠Destroy your stamina and hope by raising and pushing the price down

None of that is true.

THINK!!! Many brokers have stopped allowing you to purchase because they are in heavy danger of being forced to close the position. None of this would have happened if we were not winning.

But when will the squeeze happen then?

When they are forced to close. And there are few things that will force their hand to close.

1.	⁠Margin call

•	⁠If the price raises too much they will be forced to close, regardless of what they want. Gamma squeeze (assigned call options at expiration + Market Makers forced to buy more and more stocks as the price raises to cover purchased calls) + BUYS and HOLD will keep reducing available stocks pushing the price UP. This will speed up by a lot a margin call forcing them to close. This can take days or few weeks, depending on how fast the price raises.

1.	⁠Liquidity call - Non payable interests

•	⁠Short positions must pay interest. They can hold their position if the price doesn't snow ball BUT they will keep loosing millions every time they have to pay interest. Don't get me wrong. If they can keep the price down we will need to wait several weeks or months before they run out of money.

What am I going to do in the next days / weeks / months

Pure and simple. BUY and HOLD.

Use dips to lower my average price. Keep removing float from the market and keep pushing pressure on the short positions.

Don't let anyone fool you. The squeeze will and can happen at any price. A high price will only make it happen sooner.

Do not sell. That is the only reason why a squeeze might not happen.

My Broker and my specific actions from EUROPE

My broker is IBKR. His owner (Thomas Peterffy) has admitted a crime on television, stating that he could not let the price snowball and that people is buying a stock that should be worth $17 at $300. This is market manipulation, raw and simple and he should go to jail.

I was not planning into risking more money but that has completely change now after yesterday 's global market manipulation.

I got my salary yesterday, and those 4k+ are going straight into GME. I have a new account with Ninety Nine that allows me to buy GME.

Please, understand that I do not recommend anyone to do this. I have a personal situation that allows me to hold the position for months and keep throwing money at it.

Do not follow my strategy 'cos you read it in a post in reddit. Be responsible about your financial situation, about what you think is going to happen and act accordingly.

Do not let your broker lend your stocks so other can short GME

IBKR and others will lend your stocks to other so they can short it but they cannot do this if you have an active order for your stocks.

I have a GTC - Fill ourside RTH - LIMIT SELL order at $15.000 to avoid this. It is fucking amazing how I need to keep setting this EVERY DAY. IBKR keeps cancelling it with the ""INVALID PRICE"" reason. What the fuck invalid price.

📷This is not anymore about money (for me)

They have done a fucking huge mistake. They have made a money matter a personal and rights matter and now I am pissed the fuck off. FUCK THE MONEY and the GAINS. I AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING SELL because IT IS MY FUCKING RIGHT.

HOLD, when it finally squeezes, sell on small %s (10%) at different price points, 4500, 8500, 11000, etc.

Understand this, the stock will go as high as necessary if we do not sell cheap (<XXXX). If there are no contracts there is no limit to the price the stock can reach.

16153,16153,gl8fdul,1611956645.0,"Guys, I’m seeing a lot of dumb shit. And not good dumb, bad dumb that could be fixed with 12 seconds on Google. The same amount of time it takes you to blow your load whilst being pegged by your wife’s boyfriend. So let’s sort this out and explain what’s actually happening today, maybe.

First, short squeeze. This happens when a bunch of short positions have to close quickly. There is no expiry date on a short position, so we don’t have foresight of when this will happen. People saying the shorts have to close today are lying, or dumb, or both. That doesn’t mean we won’t (or will) get a short squeeze today, for reasons I’ll explain below.

So, what *is* going to happen today? Fuck knows. But, there’s a Gamma squeeze potentially incoming. Gamma is complicated, and foreign, but the ELI5 version is that there are a bunch of ITM calls expiring today. Note that calls do expire, unlike shorts. Calls that are ITM can be *excercised*, which means taking up the *option* of buying the underlying stock. The calls expiring today are for tens of millions of shares. You don’t *have* to exercise your ITM call, and in fact some people will be unable to do so because they don’t have the money to do so. Entirely up to you, but if *I* had ITM calls expiring today I’d be doing my best to exercise because it’s the BDE power play, and I swing like that, even with a tiny pp.

So what does that mean for us? Well, potentially, over the next few trading days there’s going to be huge demand on the buy side from these ITM expiring calls being exercised. Huge demand might increase the price if the supply isn’t able to meet it.

Where do the shorts come in then? Hah, good question little buddy, good on you for not letting that missing chromosome keep you down. Whilst shorts don’t expire, the person who sold you that short wants to have confidence that you’re good for your end of the obligation (i.e. providing the number of shares you’ve shorted). If they don’t, they can *margin call* you, which will force you to close your position by buying shares at market rate. For retail investors, this is usually dependent on the size of your portfolio and your cash position. For institutional investors, it’s complicated, like your relationship with that boy scout leader who used to shower with you. The higher the price goes, the more margin calls are going to come in. More margin calls means more people buying. More people buying means price goes up. Price going up means more margin calls and potentially future ITM calls. Means more people buying, and so on. Short squeeze.

There are also people who bought puts (remember, three main ways to bet against a stock if you’re a 🌈 🐻 is to short, to sell calls, or to buy puts) who are just going to lose money and aren’t really moving the market in the same way other positions are.

Because of this, it’s difficult to predict when, or if, a short squeeze will happen. The signal will typically be large and increasing volume matched by rocketing share prize. The snowball effect should be noticeable. Also remember that if there’s a short squeeze, it can take *days* to fully play out.

Link your dumb friends to this so they don’t spam the thread with dumb ass questions. Apes together strong, but apes dumb alone.

Happy to take corrections from your mother once she’s read this out to you. Obviously this is describing the potential, and theory, we don’t know the true position when it comes to GME to predict when or if any of this is going to happen.",2021-01-29 14:44:05

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCK

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

17036,17036,gl737sx,1611924863.0,"Alright fam, here’s my thoughts (disclosure, I’m a retard, but I’ve got a few wrinkles, a JD, and some basic addition and subtraction skills):

* GME float is roughly 47M shares. (For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).

* The number of shares short is still above 68M. 

* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. 

* This is 155% of the float. 

* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)

A number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That’s roughly 6.5M users. And, that’s only RH users. Let’s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). 

If we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that’s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that’s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it’s 5 shares, that’s 85% of the float. I don’t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. 

What does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. 

That means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail’s shares. They have to have your bananas. 

And, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That’s the squeeze. 

Don’t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk. We have no ongoing expense of ownership. The market made sure of that. So, let their actions slit their own throats. 

Don’t sell.  If you do, buy back in. Don’t let up. 

And, don’t forget, I’m an idiot. You probably shouldn’t listen to anything I say.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

**example**: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that **need** to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. **This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.**

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

**example**: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that **need** to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

I don’t have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this. 

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise. 

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses. 

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. 
When studying history (at some point we’ve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions. 

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in. 

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals?
Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around. 

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. 
WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society. 

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings. 

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‘work culture’ that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable. 

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it. 

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. 
The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over. 

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play. 

Ignore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your 💎 🙌

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

&nbsp;

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

&nbsp;

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

&nbsp;

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

&nbsp;

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

&nbsp;

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

&nbsp;

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Andrew Left takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

&nbsp;

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

&nbsp;

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

GME is not a stock right now. It is a wealth transfer funnel.

Wall Street keeps dumping more and more of their wealth into this stock (in short interest, option premiums, and covered positions) because they are greedy and they think they can outlast us: to kidnap what we've rightfully stolen.

There are only three factors in how high GME can go: their greed, their coffers, and our resolve.

If they were smart, their greed would run out, and they would cover all their shorts, and the price would plateau. But they are too greedy for that. So instead they keep dumping more and more money into short interest and premiums in the hopes that their wealth can outlast our resolve. The rising stock price is because they are literally paying us right now.

If we fold, they win. If we don't fold, then eventually they go bankrupt. That is the limit.

tl;dr: we have always been retarded but this is the least retarded we have EVER BEEN

No fucking crayons in this post. Let's look at this from a historical angle. I have been lurking since literally 2014, when this sub was filled with people posting loss porn and when people still thought the f bomb was funny and when threads weren't constant bickering between bull and bear shills

The most iconic WSB moments have also been some of the biggest collective GUHs that we have experienced as a sub. I was here when everyone was on the RAD WBA merger bullshit, when we literally thought that piece of shit RAD stock was going to MOOON to $5 per share. I lost $10K on that trade myself. I have been here for ir0nyman, and I've seen TWO separate instances of MSFT $200 tanking the entire stock market.

We are retards, easily excitable ones at that. In the past, we've gotten hyped about things that have been fully outside of the control of any retail trader. It's like, fucking free will. No matter how much we wanted those $200 4/19 puts to pan out (oh how convenient, money printer go BRRRRR), or how certain we were about quad witching (what a lame friday), the MMs and institutions ALWAYS WON. They have always been the ones to decide the rules, decide how we play. They have been the puppeteers controlling our smooth brain moves, all the while making us THINK that we had free will and an ability to make money in a RIGGED market. IMAGINE Lebron trying to win the championship for cleveland knowing that every ref had slammed GSW ML -180 with their kids' college funds

Today, we stand in the same position that michael burry, jared vennett, ben rickert, etc etc did before the 2008 financial crisis. We have collectively identified institutions that have bit off WAY more than they can chew, and they are doing everything they can to continue rigging the market to weasel their way out. Go watch the wolf of wallstreet tonight, pay for it on amazon prime with the tendies you've made from GME. DO YOU SEE THE PARALLELS? A clear case for the downfall of a multitude of financial institutions who made irresponsible, overexposed bets and thought they'd never have to pay.

“20 Million shares of GME are going to be bought because of 1/29 (January 29) calls on Friday that are expiring ITM (in the money). Don’t even think about selling until then.

I looked through the options chain for GME and there are at least 200,000 options expiring on 1/29 that are easily ITM ($200 or less). All of those calls will be exercised on Friday resulting in 20,000,000 shares of the stock needing to be purchased. The stock is going to rocket higher and harder than your wife’s boyfriend when she let him do anal for the first time.”
——————
The shorts may decide to cover their positions before that happens knowing that the stock will rocket higher. That may create a perfect storm situation.

DO NOT EVEN THINK OF SELLING UNTIL FRIDAY, and even then, it’s likely the shorts will get their positions called next week based on that kind of skyrocketing activity and this will all be game over.

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun!

Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday. SHORTS HAVE NOT CLOSED!

NOTE: THE SUPPLY OF SHORT SHARES AVAILABLE IS GOING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING, YOU SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT

For those of you who are new and scared, we raised the floor of this stock by 100% today, which is OBSCENE, just stay the course.

I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK! 💎🙌🏻

JUST HAVE FAITH AND DONT BE SCARED OF THE LITTLE SPEED BUMPS!

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $6904.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood. Now your wife has to rub your girlfriend's feet.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCK

KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

18178,18178,gl05jvt,1611812398.0,">The inexplicable rise in AMC and GameStop shares  
  
It's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  
  
Then, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are ""in the money"" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.

18285,18285,gkzjruj,1611803401.0,"Keep two things in mind:

1. GME took off the last 90 minutes of the day yesterday after being flat for a couple hours.

2. Even if GME **doesn't** take off, we are up **120%** already today, and judging from the price action today, **no shorts have covered their positions today**. Today is a HUGE win do far, even if we close at the current price.

Also, it looks like there were a few short attacks today - once in pre-market after the false news story and a couple other times throughout the morning. In all instances, the price went back almost immediately.

The short positions are in a far worse position today than they were yesterday. On top of that, for the third day in a row, **every single call option available is in the money**. After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

I am not selling any positions at all this week - I will be holding my shares and calls until late Friday at which point I plan to sell part of my call position in order to execute the rest into shares. By holding out, they've locked this in through mid next week minimum. 

This is my opinion, and not financial advice in any way. This is a speculative play not based on any fundamental valuation, and I personally am fully aware of an accept the risk associated with my investment.",2021-01-27 20:10:01

Also From [u/buntafujiwara85](https://www.reddit.com/u/buntafujiwara85/) and [u/ShadowZpeak](https://www.reddit.com/u/ShadowZpeak/):

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically, the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have an auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thank me later.

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

They DOUBLED DOWN on their shorts. 

**THEY FUCKING DOUBLED DOWN**

HIGHEST AVAILABLE CALL IS $320. If the price stays above this there will be a GAMMA SQUEEZE as we’ve seen every fucking day this week: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_squeeze

The shorts HAVE NOT SOLD THEIR POSITIONS YET. THEY DOUBLED DOWN. 

The shorts will be forced to close their positions or go bankrupt. THAT WILL TRIGGER THE SHORT SQUEEZE

**This is not a fucking joke boys. WE CONTROL THE PRICE.**

BUY THE FUCKING STOCK AND HOLD UNTIL ANDROMEDA. DO NOT GET SCARED. THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE LIVES. 

Buy fractional shares if you have to. Even $10 will squeeze them. Buy so you can tell your great grand kids you were part of the Great GameStop Short Squeeze.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.

/u/aneetsohi posted:

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

Let's focus on the months that GME was at its lowest. Sub-$4 range, from it's previous levels of ~$25. Pur yourself in their shoes. You've suppressed the price by 500%. However you're now in a position that more than 100% of shares are short. You're clearly in a position that this could short squeeze into a situation of INFINITE RISK.

Do you take your profits and call it a day? No. You DOUBLE DOWN and continue shorting shares. The stock price is THREE DOLLARS. That means your MAXIMUM UPSIDE to shorting the stock further is THREE DOLLARS. Don't forget, you already made TWENTY DOLLARS PER SHARE if you leave now. But you want that last three dollars so fucking bad.

So you come up with a genius plan. Let's take on positions with INFINITE RISK in a self-created powder keg that ~~could~~ **100% certainly will** explode at the first positive catalyst. We can increase our profits from $20 to $23 if we bankrupt this company. That's 15% MAXIMUM upside at that point. All for the low risk position of **literally infinity**.

19120,19120,gleeaol,1612064518.0,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don’t forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I’ll see you on the moon 🚀 🌚

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKD🚨 It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn’t just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called “smart money.” That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

I use Robinhood because it's the easiest place to start -- **I get on the rocket ship that is GME a little late, but still enough to see thousands of dollars worth of profit.... and here's where it get's interesting, here's what they can't grasp:**

**I CAN LOSE HALF OF THIS SHIT AND IT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY DAY TO DAY LIFE. BUT IF I HOLD HOLD HOLD I'M GONNA BE SITTING ON A THRONE OF TENDIES.**

I don't care anymore. I'm going to win a lot of money on GME, I don't give a fuck anymore what that exact number is. Fuck these assholes. It's our turn.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO 💎 🤲 AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD

20981,20981,gl20jv3,1611842040.0,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

21413,21413,gli4aro,1612145792.0,"Reasons why AMC has the potential to be huge! Much bigger than GME. First we have a lot more of a volatile movement. GME was great but it wasn't publisised as much beforehand as much AMC is, AMC has gone mainstream with people all over the world even celebrities on board not just redditors. Also at GME's peak they were restricted by criminals like robinhood trying to stop them buying stock. Hopefully by now people have found other ways to buy instead of being limited. So we have far more people on board, we won't be limited by what we can buy and 86% of the stock is shorted so all this means we could see huge gains once the squeeze kicks in. Next week could be epic! It only took 3 days for GME to go from 40 to 460 a share so let's see where we end up 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BUY & HOLD AND WE GO TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-31 19:16:32

21551,21551,glkkn52,1612189830.0,"From wsb on reddit:

""To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest""",2021-02-01 07:30:30

I love GME and BB. I like the stocks. 

I was all ready to buy BB today in the dip. I think this is a great company w. a ton of potential. They took away my gains today when they decided I couldn't buy shares. Why you ask? Because I have 27 shares and you aren't allowed to buy anymore? First they said you could only have 25, then 5, now people who don't have shares can only buy 1 share. Why!!!!!!!! If the price is so fucking low then...and continues to drop.....why? Obviously there are more shares right? People are selling right? No. They are just purposely driving the price down SO THEY CAN COVER THEIR SHORT POSITIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK THEM.

We need immediate assistance from whoever the fuck cares enough and has the power to do it. SEC load up and just act like you are the $$$ FBI and roll up and shut this shit down. Do your jobs. Dont stand by twiddling your thumbs wondering how you will proceed once this shit show is over. I dont want a slap on the wrist. I want people behind bars. I want to sue. I want the world to know what Citadel, Robinhood, and the media (CNBC im extra looking at you) have been doing. Not JUST trying to manipulate us (you and me). But everyone. I am sick of it. 

You want to play dirty. You want some conflict. Fine. I won't sell. I will ammo up and only buy. I will preach. I will shout. I will scream. I will fight. I will give love to my fellow tards. I will catch up all the poor boomers on facebook who dont know any better... real quick on whats going on and give them the real story. 

If you got me against the wall then baby you are on the edge of a cliff.

22265,22265,glbvtfw,1612006411.0,"tldr: Hold your AMC until at least 200. Selling before then will just ruin it for you and everyone else. Today was a victory, but the war has just begun.

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

HOLD YOUR AMC SHARES UNTIL AT LEAST $200 A SHARE. THE LONGER WE HOLD, THE HARDER THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. AT 200 WE WILL DECIDE IF WE HOLD AND PUSH FOR HIGHER NUMBERS OR IF WE SETTLE (MOST LIKELY WE WILL HOLD FOR MORE). Remember, the longer we hold, the more the hedge fund bastards will have to pay in fees. We will rinse them out.

HOLD YOUR AMC. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HEDGE'S SCARE TACTICS. THEY WILL SHORT LADDER, PASS FAKE NEWS, WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. WE WILL HOLD OUT. DIAMOND HANDS. SET YOUR SELL LIMITS TO 200. WE WILL SHOW JUST HOW STRONG WE ARE TOGETHER. 

This may take a few days. Maybe even a couple weeks. Just look at $GME. But we stand together, and we rise.

22860,22860,gl1e8pd,1611830370.0,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them.

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii’s were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

“Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

They are STILL borrowing shares to short. See how the number is decreasing! That means Short Float IS INCREASING (250% now)!

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

They can only even borrow 75,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun!

Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday. SHORTS HAVE NOT CLOSED!

NOTE: THE SUPPLY OF SHORT SHARES AVAILABLE IS GOING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING, YOU SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT

For those of you who are new and scared, we raised the floor of this stock by 100% today, which is OBSCENE, just stay the course.

( This is copied from a fellow redditor. I did not write this. This is not financial advice. Just do your research and make the best decisions for you.)

EDIT: This is a once in a lifetime event that they will never risk happening ever again.

Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME. Their shorts don't expire, naked shorting, 140$ short interest, their weekly and monthly expire on friday and all we need to do is hold onto our shares so that they can't have them and INFINITE SQUEEZE JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all.

HOLDING UNTIL $69420.00 PER SHARE. Fuck you Wall Street. We're taking our fucking money back

EDIT2: I don't know a day. I don't know how long it will go. I do know that there's nothing they can do, nowhere for them to go if we hold. Then we're gonna see the stock multiply suddenly by 5, by 10, by 100 and that's the moment we're going to be making some new money millionaires all over the country. Godspeed everyone.

Our fall? Who wishes it so? Robinhood?

No, Robinhood;  
If we are mark'd to lose tendies, we are enough  
To do our brothers loss; and if we are to get tendies,  
The fewer men, the greater share of honor.  
God's will! I pray thee, wish not for one paper hands more in our fight.

By Robinhood, I am not covetous for gold,  
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;  
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;  
Such outward things dwell not in my desires.

But if it be a sin to covet HONOR,  
I am the most offending soul alive 💎🙌💎🙌.

No, faith, my bros, wish not a man from the middle class.  
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honor  
As one man more methinks would share from me  
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!  
Rather proclaim it, Robinhood, through my host,  
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,  
Let him depart; his passport shall be made,  
And crowns for convoy put into his purse;  
We would not lose tendies in that man's company  
That fears his fellowship to lose tendies with us 💎🙌.

This day is call'd the feast of $GME.  
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,  
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,  
And rouse him at the name of $GME.  
He that shall live this day, and see old age,  
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,  
And say ""To-morrow is $GME.""  
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,  
And say ""These wounds I had on $GME day.""

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,  
But he'll remember, with advantages,  
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,  
Familiar in his mouth as household words—  
Chamath, Elon, DFV, Warren, AOC the Gamestop Bunny—  
Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.

**This story shall the good man teach his son;**  
**And $GME day shall ne'er go by,**  
**From this day to the ending of the world,**  
**But we in it shall be rememberèd—**  
**We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;**  
**For he to-day that sheds his blood with me**  
**Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,**  
**This day shall gentle his condition;**  
**And gentlemen in WSB now a-bed**  
**Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,**  
**And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks**  
**That fought with us upon $GME day.** 💎🙌🚀",2021-01-28 17:16:15

People from Germany, Korea, Canada, everywhere are throwing their support! World wide unity for a single cause!

I'm not an emotional person, and I do have a position in GME (for disclosure) but it truly is uplifting to see that we are not being swept away, we are being LENT a voice, we are being given an instrument to fight back.

When the price plummeted, dread set in. I thought to myself, REALLY? THEY ARE GOING TO WIN? THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY HOPE FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. Like darkness was descending, the walls were falling, and Wallstreet was coming in to finish us off. And the a dim light appeared. Then another. And suddenly, we weren't just huddling in a corner, HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, because if this went tits up, many people were going to be SERIOUISLY, perhaps, irreversibly be ruined.

Chamath it said it. What side of history do you want to be on?

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY 

UPVOTE AND SHARE 

In the last hour of trading, some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

A) They have to pay interest on their short. Every day this continues it costs them more and more money just to continue to stay in the ring.

B) The PRICE is the price that the last share sold for. Stop worrying about it. Instead, look at the volumes. If their only game plan is to ""tank the price"" by selling a trickle of of shares then theyre just making their situation worse and that's what has been happening. The share price goes down on just a handful of shares and are quickly scooped back up. The short is still going to be a huge % of the float.

C) They're being investigated right now. Expect them to run out of dirty tricks soon.

So yes, their main play now is to make us bored and move on. The thing is that costs them money. If shareholders don't get bored and continue to hold then the GME short squeeze will happen.

3) The longer short sellers wait to buy shares, the more interest they have to pay, thus increasing their pressure to buy.

23720,23720,glajzho,1611984136.0,"This to consider moving forward:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the GME explosion, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME.

3. Robinhood, Webull, etc. are trying to point fingers all over the place as though they don't share blame in anything. But YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were. That's grotesquely and blatantly market manipulation. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. If even 1k of us did that, that's a major ad revenue / data loss for Google.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees. This matters.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY 

UPVOTE AND SHARE 

In the last hour of trading, some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all. 

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",2021-01-25 19:00:00

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON. WE LIKE THE STOCK

# When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&restrict_sr=1)

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

* Days  to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days  to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days  to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares  and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the  company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

\-  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same  thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin  Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take  alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share  movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This steady ride we’ve been on today so far suggests they could very well be waiting for an hour or so before closing bell to start their short ladder attack. A good chunk of their put options of $115 expire today, and if they can tank the price share below that, it’ll be a MAJOR victory for them. The only way this will happen is if we sell our shares. They’re betting we will see this fabricated plummet and sell our shares, enabling them to buy them up and strengthen their dying breaths, giving them one more week to avoid the deathblow.

There is also a massive volume of currently ITM calls at $320, if I were a short I’d be waiting till end of day to launch an attack to hopefully leave these calls un-exercisable.

In order to rebuff an attack there needs to be enough buying at that price to counteract the momentum of the attack. I’ve set a limit buy order at $320 for what I can afford. If you’re looking for a good entry point, this is it. This is a huge battle in the war of GME.

Worst case scenario there is also a large volume of puts at $300. If $320 is too high consider $300, if they’re able to close those out it’s a huge loss for us.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1. Go to Feb 5 option.
2. Scroll all the way down the call list
3. Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4. Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

\- Part of the sell off is panic rather than liquidation for covering. Many people want to get out of stocks (e.g. move to treasury bonds) before this gets worse and hurts their positions.

\- The outstanding short is still estimated to be well over 100% of the outstanding shares. Today's price is stable (relative for GME anyway) around the normal trading bands of 345-310. Will it pusher higher than 345 probably, will it fall lower than 310, unlikely. The past low points in the sell cycles have been higher when mean the selling positions have had less volume. Will it approach higher than 400, unlikely as well. At least not today.

\- This is not the short squeeze.  Today's volume is extremely light, 20m in 2 hours out with only 4.5 hours remaining. Avg volume is 101m. The shorts don't want to cover currently because they are expecting another dip like yesterday.

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. BUT WE CANNOT SELL!

There are still MASSIVE amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (from S3 Partners). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many NEW shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.

Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!

BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is HOLD. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.
We're not fucking blinking.

TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!

A good chunk of their put options of $115 expire today, and if they can tank the price share below that, it’ll be a MAJOR victory for them. The only way this will happen is if we sell our shares. They’re betting we will see this fabricated plummet and sell our shares, enabling them to buy them up and strengthen their dying breaths, giving them one more week to avoid the deathblow.

There is also a massive volume of currently ITM calls at $320, if I were a short I’d be waiting till end of day to launch an attack to hopefully leave these calls un-exercisable.

In order to rebuff an attack there needs to be enough buying at that price to counteract the momentum of the attack. I’ve set a limit buy order at $320 for what I can afford. If you’re looking for a good entry point, this is it. This is a huge battle in the war of GME.

Worst case scenario there is also a large volume of puts at $300. If $320 is too high consider $300, if they’re able to close those out it’s a huge loss for us.

1. The market is TERRIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the GME explosion, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that it was all being done to make us sell GME.

3. Robinhood, Webull, etc. are trying to point fingers all over the place as though they don't share blame in anything. They're being sued, and rightfully so. They engaged in blatant market manipulation, and the laws need to change NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. A word of caution. Short positions aren't fully known because we aren't given the data that hedge funds are. Also, they could choose to start lying about their positions and face pretty negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. This is why it's ALSO important to maintain an watch on borrow rates and short shares available. There are people here much better at this than I, but as far as I can tell, so far, so good. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme)

5. We don't know when short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. We can't know WHEN the shorts will be covered, so if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. If even 1k of us did that, that's a major ad revenue / data loss for Google.

If you're reading the posts about what a sell wall is or came here to ask how to buy call options on $GME with your $550 newly minted trading account then I will slow it down for you as much as I can.

The reason these brokers are not allowing buy orders right now is not *necessarily* because they hate the poors (they do), but has more to do with SYSTEMATIC RISK. This $GME bonanza has gone farther than any of them could have ever thought up in their feverish wet nightmares about fucking poor people in the ass.

At the end of every single trading day the brokers/clearing houses have to hoard away a % of all transactions in CASH and it has to sit there for at least 2 days to make sure everyone gets paid out for those trades. This is a regulation that they have no way around. For $GME the % is currently set to ***100%*** that means every screeching retard who paper hands into the void requires them to hold 100% of the traded value in cash for 2 days. Take the 300-500 SP we have been seeing and multiply it by the 200 million volume we were seeing and if enough of your brain cells are hooked together properly you will start to realize what the problem is.

These firms are required to hold ***hundreds of billions of dollars*** in cash for multiple days from $GME alone. The systematic risk that this applies to these institutions cannot be understated, which is why you are seeing the entire market start to take a steamy dump.

That being said, these smaller brokers especially are SHITTING THEIR PANTS about this, requiring them to do the illegal/borderline illegal things you are seeing. They should have realized the risk involved and halted the stock entirely if they weren't going to allow buying, but that would require them to admit the system was under catastrophic pressure.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 DD

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. BUT WE CANNOT SELL!

There are still MASSIVE amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (from S3 Partners). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many NEW shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.

Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!

BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is HOLD. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.
We're not fucking blinking.

TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!

24825,24825,glbjtm9,1612000501.0,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it​",2021-01-30 02:55:01

BlackRock, the largest asset manager, has recently increased its ownership of the company to 6 percent. Plus, I believe NOK will increase its market share, significantly taking a lot from Huawei soon.

GME was great but it wasn't publisised as much beforehand as much AMC is, AMC has gone mainstream with people all over the world even celebrities on board not just redditors. Also at GME's peak they were restricted by criminals like robinhood trying to stop them buying stock. Hopefully by now people have found other ways to buy instead of being limited. So we have far more people on board, we won't be limited by what we can buy and 86% of the stock is shorted so all this means we could see huge gains once the squeeze kicks in. Next week could be epic! It only took 3 days for GME to go from 40 to 460 a share so let's see where we end up 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BUY & HOLD AND WE GO TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-31 19:16:32

25661,25661,glkkn52,1612189830.0,"From wsb on reddit:

""To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest""",2021-02-01 07:30:30

25952,25952,glcm9v1,1612024250.0,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest",2021-01-30 09:30:50

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They  didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

They  didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

27331,27331,gl05jvt,1611812398.0,">The inexplicable rise in AMC and GameStop shares  
  
It's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  
  
Then, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are ""in the money"" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

There’s thousands of us literally jumping for joy from the gains we’ve made these last few days/weeks/months. Excited to pay bills, pay rent, buy FOOD. Literally never having seen this level of “winning” before in their lives. This euphoria that these billionaires are fucking numb to. 

They have it all already. They were born with a silver spoon and have committed to growing it to a ladle. Never having to worry about payment, costs of living, affording luxuries that we the people can only dream of. Yet they take the other side of this trade. Afraid to let the little guy have that feeling just once. Afraid of their position in society being tampered with while there’s really room for all. 

Using every dirty/unfair/benevolent tactic in the book to ensure we don’t have our god damn day in the sun. It’s despicable and downright fucking cruel. I’ve never seen a more imposed/righteous level of wealth transfer from the hands of people who can afford to lose it, to the people who no longer can sit back and watch them take it all in. I’ll be damned if I’m not apart of this.

Estimated losses for the shorts with GME at 120 were 8 billion

Estimated losses at 130 were 13 billion because of escalation.

It's now at 226.  That's what?  29?  31 billion?  The math is really complicated at these levels.  It's never been seen before so quickly.

They  fought like hell to hold the $150 line all day.  That was where they  drew the line in the sand.  Which tells us that that's the level at  which these guys were risking margin call.

The  news broke today that, in an effort to stem the bleeding, Melvin was  cutting his shorts with a battery maker and a pharma company (Vartas  and...I can't think of the other one) that were dragging him down....but  that he was keeping the GME shorts.

Probably out of a personal vendetta.

That 2.7 dollars he just got lifelined?  It's fucking gone.  It lasted one fucking day.

Which means, if we took him out....we probably took at least 1, probably 3 or 4, other smaller funds out with him.

27515,27515,gl1ov2q,1611835441.0,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen.

ONLY put in what you don't care to lose, especially in GME. Better to have 70million folks buy 1 share that they don't care to lose/sell instead of the a few thousand folks yolo-ing all their worth.

We have broken new ground in the psychology of this movement. It may not all be about the gains, and more about the message. Big investors joining at this point are not doing so as a ""prudent investor"", but rather to be a part of the message they believe in.

2) Yes, hold your shares even when you see the stock dip like mad tomorrow - it's pretty much guaranteed to happen since the shorts will be dead if they allow the stock to remain at this price.

3) No, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and take the time to understand why this GME trade might be the best thing the world has seen since sliced bread.

As for me? All in on GME at 1281 shares. The fact that market makers are fighting so desperately to drop the share price should tell you that they're feeling the pressure.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

# When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&restrict_sr=1)

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

* Days  to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days  to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days  to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares  and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the  company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

\-  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same  thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin  Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take  alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share  movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This steady ride we’ve been on today so far suggests they could very well be waiting for an hour or so before closing bell to start their short ladder attack. A good chunk of their put options of $115 expire today, and if they can tank the price share below that, it’ll be a MAJOR victory for them. The only way this will happen is if we sell our shares. They’re betting we will see this fabricated plummet and sell our shares, enabling them to buy them up and strengthen their dying breaths, giving them one more week to avoid the deathblow.

There is also a massive volume of currently ITM calls at $320, if I were a short I’d be waiting till end of day to launch an attack to hopefully leave these calls un-exercisable.

In order to rebuff an attack there needs to be enough buying at that price to counteract the momentum of the attack. I’ve set a limit buy order at $320 for what I can afford. If you’re looking for a good entry point, this is it. This is a huge battle in the war of GME.

Worst case scenario there is also a large volume of puts at $300. If $320 is too high consider $300, if they’re able to close those out it’s a huge loss for us.

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

28241,28241,gl94syo,1611966213.0,"Update on the price range and selling off:

\- Part of the sell off is panic rather than liquidation for covering. Many people want to get out of stocks (e.g. move to treasury bonds) before this gets worse and hurts their positions.

\- The outstanding short is still estimated to be well over 100% of the outstanding shares. Today's price is stable (relative for GME anyway) around the normal trading bands of 345-310. Will it pusher higher than 345 probably, will it fall lower than 310, unlikely. The past low points in the sell cycles have been higher when mean the selling positions have had less volume. Will it approach higher than 400, unlikely as well. At least not today.

\- This is not the short squeeze.  Today's volume is extremely light, 20m in 2 hours out with only 4.5 hours remaining. Avg volume is 101m. The shorts don't want to cover currently because they are expecting another dip like yesterday.

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. BUT WE CANNOT SELL!

There are still MASSIVE amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (from S3 Partners). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many NEW shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.

Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!

BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is HOLD. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.
We're not fucking blinking.

1. The market is TERRIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the GME explosion, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that it was all being done to make us sell GME.

3. Robinhood, Webull, etc. are trying to point fingers all over the place as though they don't share blame in anything. They're being sued, and rightfully so. They engaged in blatant market manipulation, and the laws need to change NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. A word of caution. Short positions aren't fully known because we aren't given the data that hedge funds are. Also, they could choose to start lying about their positions and face pretty negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose.

There are people here much better at this than I, but as far as I can tell, so far, so good. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme)

5. We don't know when short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. We can't know WHEN the shorts will be covered, so if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. If even 1k of us did that, that's a major ad revenue / data loss for Google.

If you're reading the posts about what a sell wall is or came here to ask how to buy call options on $GME with your $550 newly minted trading account then I will slow it down for you as much as I can.

The reason these brokers are not allowing buy orders right now is not *necessarily* because they hate the poors (they do), but has more to do with SYSTEMATIC RISK. This $GME bonanza has gone farther than any of them could have ever thought up in their feverish wet nightmares about fucking poor people in the ass.

At the end of every single trading day the brokers/clearing houses have to hoard away a % of all transactions in CASH and it has to sit there for at least 2 days to make sure everyone gets paid out for those trades. This is a regulation that they have no way around. For $GME the % is currently set to ***100%*** that means every screeching retard who paper hands into the void requires them to hold 100% of the traded value in cash for 2 days. Take the 300-500 SP we have been seeing and multiply it by the 200 million volume we were seeing and if enough of your brain cells are hooked together properly you will start to realize what the problem is.

These firms are required to hold ***hundreds of billions of dollars*** in cash for multiple days from $GME alone. The systematic risk that this applies to these institutions cannot be understated, which is why you are seeing the entire market start to take a steamy dump.

That being said, these smaller brokers especially are SHITTING THEIR PANTS about this, requiring them to do the illegal/borderline illegal things you are seeing. They should have realized the risk involved and halted the stock entirely if they weren't going to allow buying, but that would require them to admit the system was under catastrophic pressure.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 DD

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. BUT WE CANNOT SELL!

There are still MASSIVE amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (from S3 Partners). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many NEW shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.

Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!

BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is HOLD. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.
We're not fucking blinking.

TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!

You have five beautiful children, six cars, a dozen properties and three homes. You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation.

• We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

• The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

• WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Melvin haven't closed out. This is a manipulation tactic to drive down prices, either to cover their losses, or they've made a put at $350. This is the dirtiest trick yet, so they must be desperate. If we smash through $350, they are probably done permanently.

There are also other shorts open, for taking which we don't focus on. They still need to be squashed.

All this does is present a last chance to get on the rocket if you haven't done so already.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don’t understand what’s going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

I am not selling any positions at all this week - I will be holding my shares and calls until late Friday at which point I plan to sell part of my call position in order to execute the rest into shares. By holding out, they've locked this in through mid next week minimum. 

This is my opinion, and not financial advice in any way. This is a speculative play not based on any fundamental valuation, and I personally am fully aware of an accept the risk associated with my investment.",2021-01-27 20:10:01

Also From [u/buntafujiwara85](https://www.reddit.com/u/buntafujiwara85/) and [u/ShadowZpeak](https://www.reddit.com/u/ShadowZpeak/):

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically, the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have an auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thank me later.

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

/u/aneetsohi posted:

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

Let's focus on the months that GME was at its lowest. Sub-$4 range, from it's previous levels of ~$25. Pur yourself in their shoes. You've suppressed the price by 500%. However you're now in a position that more than 100% of shares are short. You're clearly in a position that this could short squeeze into a situation of INFINITE RISK.

Do you take your profits and call it a day? No. You DOUBLE DOWN and continue shorting shares. The stock price is THREE DOLLARS. That means your MAXIMUM UPSIDE to shorting the stock further is THREE DOLLARS. Don't forget, you already made TWENTY DOLLARS PER SHARE if you leave now. But you want that last three dollars so fucking bad.

So you come up with a genius plan. Let's take on positions with INFINITE RISK in a self-created powder keg that ~~could~~ **100% certainly will** explode at the first positive catalyst. We can increase our profits from $20 to $23 if we bankrupt this company. That's 15% MAXIMUM upside at that point. All for the low risk position of **literally infinity**.

29423,29423,gl737sx,1611924863.0,"Alright fam, here’s my thoughts (disclosure, I’m a retard, but I’ve got a few wrinkles, a JD, and some basic addition and subtraction skills):

* GME float is roughly 47M shares. (For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).

* The number of shares short is still above 68M. 

* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. 

* This is 155% of the float. 

* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)

A number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That’s roughly 6.5M users. And, that’s only RH users. Let’s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). 

If we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that’s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that’s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it’s 5 shares, that’s 85% of the float. I don’t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. 

What does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. 

That means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail’s shares. They have to have your bananas. 

And, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That’s the squeeze. 

Don’t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk. We have no ongoing expense of ownership. The market made sure of that. So, let their actions slit their own throats. 

Don’t sell.  If you do, buy back in. Don’t let up. 

And, don’t forget, I’m an idiot. You probably shouldn’t listen to anything I say.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

I have over 6 figures in the bank from the sale of my house, I’m renting now as I’m going to build my own place over the next few years. 

I decided to take a small chunk and bought into GME on Monday at $90. I bought more at at $250, much to the absolute disgust of my wife. At that point, I’d bought all I could with the cash I could get into trading accounts. 

I woke up early this morning to discover my TD account funded overnight and immediately bought more, at over $400......I haven’t got around to discussing this one with my wife yet! 

At the outset, I was honestly going to be happy making a few thousand bucks, and I went into it eyes wide open that it was a gamble.

However, immediately after I bought the last amount, the fuckery began. I’ve been raging all day and the chances of me selling now are absolute fucking zero.

I want to watch these motherfuckers squirm and suffer as the price goes into orbit. I’m a stubborn and  militant bastard at the best of times, but today I went nuclear.

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

I don’t have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this. 

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise. 

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses. 

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. 
When studying history (at some point we’ve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions. 

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in. 

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals?
Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around. 

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. 
WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society. 

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings. 

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‘work culture’ that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable. 

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it. 

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. 
The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over. 

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play. 

Ignore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your 💎 🙌

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

&nbsp;

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

&nbsp;

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

&nbsp;

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

&nbsp;

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

&nbsp;

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

&nbsp;

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Andrew Left takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

&nbsp;

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

&nbsp;

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

**DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.**

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

29721,29721,gl7nnd6,1611937353.0,"I hear a lot of people claiming that what's happening here with GME is some sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand.

29918,29918,gl1e8pd,1611830370.0,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

For those who want some excellent DD, here's a quick selection

So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii’s were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

1) Friday may not be the day. Shorts DO NOT HAVE TO COVER. There is no expiration on those, unless the institution that lent them those shares demands that they cover.

2) Calls that expire Friday do NOT need to be covered by institutions until the next week Mon/Tues (they have 3 days). So even that massive open interest that's ITM may not spur huge movements until next week. Stay patient.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

“Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

If you've watched any of DFV's youtube videos you can easily tell that the ridiculous short against gme is not the only reason he invested heavily into gamestop. He genuinely believes in the future if gamestop and he feels that they will definitely turn things around going forward, not only that but might even go onto becoming a solid institution by itself. He's done some solid research and has clearly predicted everything correctly. As the name suggests hes a VALUE investor which means he is absolutely not going to sell even if the price goes below 100 cuz hes in it for the long run.

30973,30973,glay021,1611990088.0,"Re: Gamestop

Fellow humans: This is more than a meme. This is more than a way to earn a quick dollar. This is more than a way to fuck over rich people. This is a social movement. This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.

What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.

What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us “amateur” traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids’ schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. 

What can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that “these reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.” That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. 

If you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT. I am not a financial advisor, I am not “smart” enough. I am just a concerned individual who likes the stock.

AMC has to close out above $9 bare minimum, although I think it’ll soar tomorrow. If it closes above $9, options closing tomorrow cannot be covered/exercised/filled. Options for AMC over $9 do not exist. If you don’t know what any of this means, in short, this is what starts the actual short squeeze. And when it happens- the possibility of price target is truly astronomical, until it naturally ends. These short squeezes may end up being some of the biggest ones in history. Millionaires will be made over night. No joke. Sounds to good to be true, but it also only happens once in a blue moon. Buy and hold. Don’t buy all at once either. Buy small amounts of shares here and there as the price increases. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Don’t be surprised if this squeeze continues into next week all the way to Friday. $$$$$

31272,31272,glgob8m,1612110612.0,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

I am not a financial advisor i just spreading the information from others.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest",2021-01-31 09:30:12

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",2021-01-25 19:00:00

31612,31612,gkqnfj0,1611631084.0,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1⁠⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2⁠⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3⁠⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4⁠⁠Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5⁠⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6⁠⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7⁠⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",2021-01-29 04:20:37

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",2021-01-29 04:20:37

They had a guest and a interview clip, and the FINAL POINT WAS THAT THEY'RE NOT SURE IF ANY THING ILLEGAL HAPPENED... BUT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATING OF MARKET MANIPULATION BY REDDIT! THAT WE CAN SHARE OPINION BUT NOT BAND TOGETHER OR SHARE FALSE INFORMATION. (SOUND FAMILIAR CNBC?!)

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment).

-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today!

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more.

Personally I'm not going to suggest brokerages that did this when anyone asks for brokerage recommendations on here in the future. Not that I really recommended RH for ages anyways, but apparently going forward it's Fidelity and Etrade when people ask I guess.

You're talking about the head of the Nasdaq saying that trading in situations like GME should be paused so that pros can ""recalibrate?"" When my investments toilet, can I get a trade halt? 

As others have noted, this basically confirms a lot of what WSB have been saying. 

Is this some attempt for firms to try to ""protect"" people? Some people will end up losing big in this whole thing and that's unfortunate, but even if so, can't start stopping trading (what's the rules-based exact reason why RH is not allowing trading in these names?) because once you do it it's a slippery slope - what becomes, ""too much, gotta stop trading""?

I tell people on here that you're going to make mistakes and you have to learn from your errors and over time you hopefully evolve into a better investor. Apparently, when major funds make real mistakes, they don't have to learn from their mistakes, they yell for the ref to halt the game. When this GME squeeze is over (and it will be at some point - it isn't going to infinity), some people are going to be the bagholders and that's unfortunate but my question is, when GME reverses and there's volatility to the downside, will the same brokerages halt trading in these names again or no?

Whether you are for what WSB did or not, I think everyone can agree that this ""rules for me but not for thee.""  And maybe that's the way things are going to be and people have to adapt, but it's still pretty dismaying.

If this somehow shows how broken the system is (i don't think it's going to cause some sort of market crash, it will stop sooner than later), then that was going to happen eventually anyways.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced multiple stocks including NOK, AMC, BB, GME to be driven down after hours. Further more, searching the platform for ANY symbol has been disabled, and during critical periods the platform is unavailable. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

&#x200B;

Robinhood has suddenly change the rules under the guise of ""protecting"" us when in reality they are directly affecting the outcomes of positions in which I and many others hold stake during a critical period, and by extension putting retail investors at heightened risk, and the only ones standing to benefit from this are the hedge funds with the most to lose on their short positions.

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

“Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it.”

GME is not a stock right now. It is a wealth transfer funnel.

Wall Street keeps dumping more and more of their wealth into this stock (in short interest, option premiums, and covered positions) because they are greedy and they think they can outlast us: to kidnap what we've rightfully stolen.

There are only three factors in how high GME can go: their greed, their coffers, and our resolve.

If they were smart, their greed would run out, and they would cover all their shorts, and the price would plateau. But they are too greedy for that. So instead they keep dumping more and more money into short interest and premiums in the hopes that their wealth can outlast our resolve. The rising stock price is because they are literally paying us right now.

If we fold, they win. If we don't fold, then eventually they go bankrupt. That is the limit.

tl;dr: we have always been retarded but this is the least retarded we have EVER BEEN

No fucking crayons in this post. Let's look at this from a historical angle. I have been lurking since literally 2014, when this sub was filled with people posting loss porn and when people still thought the f bomb was funny and when threads weren't constant bickering between bull and bear shills

The most iconic WSB moments have also been some of the biggest collective GUHs that we have experienced as a sub. I was here when everyone was on the RAD WBA merger bullshit, when we literally thought that piece of shit RAD stock was going to MOOON to $5 per share. I lost $10K on that trade myself. I have been here for ir0nyman, and I've seen TWO separate instances of MSFT $200 tanking the entire stock market.

We are retards, easily excitable ones at that. In the past, we've gotten hyped about things that have been fully outside of the control of any retail trader. It's like, fucking free will. No matter how much we wanted those $200 4/19 puts to pan out (oh how convenient, money printer go BRRRRR), or how certain we were about quad witching (what a lame friday), the MMs and institutions ALWAYS WON. They have always been the ones to decide the rules, decide how we play. They have been the puppeteers controlling our smooth brain moves, all the while making us THINK that we had free will and an ability to make money in a RIGGED market. IMAGINE Lebron trying to win the championship for cleveland knowing that every ref had slammed GSW ML -180 with their kids' college funds

Today, we stand in the same position that michael burry, jared vennett, ben rickert, etc etc did before the 2008 financial crisis. We have collectively identified institutions that have bit off WAY more than they can chew, and they are doing everything they can to continue rigging the market to weasel their way out. Go watch the wolf of wallstreet tonight, pay for it on amazon prime with the tendies you've made from GME. DO YOU SEE THE PARALLELS? A clear case for the downfall of a multitude of financial institutions who made irresponsible, overexposed bets and thought they'd never have to pay.

“20 Million shares of GME are going to be bought because of 1/29 (January 29) calls on Friday that are expiring ITM (in the money). Don’t even think about selling until then.

I looked through the options chain for GME and there are at least 200,000 options expiring on 1/29 that are easily ITM ($200 or less). All of those calls will be exercised on Friday resulting in 20,000,000 shares of the stock needing to be purchased. The stock is going to rocket higher and harder than your wife’s boyfriend when she let him do anal for the first time.”
——————
The shorts may decide to cover their positions before that happens knowing that the stock will rocket higher. That may create a perfect storm situation.

DO NOT EVEN THINK OF SELLING UNTIL FRIDAY, and even then, it’s likely the shorts will get their positions called next week based on that kind of skyrocketing activity and this will all be game over.

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $6904.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood. Now your wife has to rub your girlfriend's feet.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Thank you RK for your initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world.

Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under?

I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing.

If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry.

GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality.

People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.

Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.

GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?

Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.

I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.

Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.

Retail investors discovered this and began buying the security to leverage against their position. Melvin Capital was granted close to 2.7 billion dollars in loans by Citadel Securities, LLC (investment firm) for liquidity.**

**Citadel Securities (market maker) processes ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL, LLC’s transactions. To prevent further losses, they potentially pressured Robinhood to restrict buying of specific stocks such as GME, AMC, NOK, and others by retail investors. As of 1/28, GME is specifically blocked from being bought on Robinhood - an unprecedented event following no actual SEC rules or Robinhood terms and conditions.**

**Other retail trading sites continue to allow trades - this is Robinhood specifically curtailing market action, likely under specific pressure from Citadel and Citadel Securities.**
**Note that although they are separate corporate entities, Citadel and Citadel Securities are owned by the same individual - Ken Griffin.**

**These companies seem to be colluding behind the scenes to block legitimate investment actions by individuals, to their own profit. Their communications may reveal this manipulation.**

**Thus:**
**We make the argument that Robinhood Financial, LLC in coordination with Citadel Securites, LLC and Melvin Capital Management, LP willfully engaged in market manipulation by restricting buying power of the security GME by actionably preventing its users from exercising their financial leverage to cover their position. This has resulted in immeasurable losses to millions of users unable to trade the security in a way that is financially in their best interest according to their own belief.**

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow.

33588,33588,glcwhmp,1612034157.0,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",2021-01-30 12:15:57

My recommendation:  
1. HOLD  
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise  
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.
