I was all ready to buy BB today in the dip. I think this is a great company w. a ton of potential. They took away my gains today when they decided I couldn't buy shares. Why you ask? Because I have 27 shares and you aren't allowed to buy anymore? First they said you could only have 25, then 5, now people who don't have shares can only buy 1 share. Why!!!!!!!! If the price is so fucking low then...and continues to drop.....why? Obviously there are more shares right? People are selling right? No. They are just purposely driving the price down SO THEY CAN COVER THEIR SHORT POSITIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK THEM.

Dont stand by twiddling your thumbs wondering how you will proceed once this shit show is over. I dont want a slap on the wrist. I want people behind bars. I want to sue. I want the world to know what Citadel, Robinhood, and the media (CNBC im extra looking at you) have been doing. Not JUST trying to manipulate us (you and me). But everyone. I am sick of it. 

You want to play dirty. You want some conflict. Fine. I won't sell. I will ammo up and only buy. I will preach. I will shout. I will scream. I will fight. I will give love to my fellow tards. I will catch up all the poor boomers on facebook who dont know any better... real quick on whats going on and give them the real story. 

If you got me against the wall then baby you are on the edge of a cliff.

I have to admit at first I thought these bastards were going to get away with painting us as evil, conniving, soulless degenerates (well, that part we are) hell bent on robbing the public's money.

BUT I'm overwhelmed by the public display of support for us AND the denouncement of these Wallstreet criminals.

The world's richest man Tweeted for us. TWICE.

Politicians openly demand a review of Wallstreet.

A famous pornstar gave us direction and inspiration as we were being silenced.

People from Germany, Korea, Canada, everywhere are throwing their support! World wide unity for a single cause!

JA FUCKING RULE entered the chat! JA RULE!

I'm not an emotional person, and I do have a position in GME (for disclosure) but it truly is uplifting to see that we are not being swept away, we are being LENT a voice, we are being given an instrument to fight back.

When the price plummeted, dread set in. I thought to myself, REALLY? THEY ARE GOING TO WIN? THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY HOPE FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. Like darkness was descending, the walls were falling, and Wallstreet was coming in to finish us off. And the a dim light appeared. Then another. And suddenly, we weren't just huddling in a corner, HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, because if this went tits up, many people were going to be SERIOUISLY, perhaps, irreversibly be ruined.

Chamath it said it. What side of history do you want to be on?

The side where billionaires live to see the day where their yachts and mansions and penthouses are untouched and millions of hardworking people are BANKRUPTED?

Or one where the little guy feasts for one night and maybe rescues their entire generation?

No matter how this ends, I wanted to let everyone here know (and anyone just standing on the sidelines too) that WE DID something special. 2020 was utter crap but it lead up to this. The EVIL and GREED and CORRUPTION are on FULL DISPLAY because of what a bunch of ""retards"" and ""autists"" did.",2021-01-28

Which means, as soon as they open the GME and BB to buy again, the price will shoot back up. 

Also, regardless, this Friday there is a massive Gamma squeeze coming in.. so it will go above yesterday close for sure.

Look at the Open Interest (OI) column, this indicates the total number of option contracts that are held by investors in active positions. The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

If we retailers also hold and if the price goes back up to 30 or so, we might be able to trigger a mini squeeze.  Any squeeze definitely will not be in the magnitude of GME or AMC, but BB is a different beast as it has a lot more long term potential.  Feel much more comfortable buying and holding this than GME, but I am still holding GME.

One potential good catalyst is if GME / AMC resolves and people take profits, people here will want something to roll their profits into.  BB is one of the stocks on WSB and can be seen as a lot more stable, so it might be a boon for all of us.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

7847,7847,gl7hfdr,1611932990.0,"AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 & The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.  💎  🙌",2021-01-29

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

**Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!**

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the fund that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

**READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!**

**EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!**

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is **""Days to Cover""** or **""Short Ratio""** .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? **You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""**

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, **it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.**

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning **if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!** So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. **No need to panic sell.** No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the **short ratio.** If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, **NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? **$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.** If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

still holding. nothing about this company has fundementally changed other than hedge funds manipulating the buying pressure. If the only option is to sell of course it will drop. This is not a natural drop, its been manipulated by hedge funds to try to drop the price to cover their shorts. 
Look at how many shares are being shorted and at what price here. They want to drop the price because they are going to lose a TON of money offloading the shorts right now. 

If the price keeps going up they will have no choice but to buy the premium or risk getting margin called when all the available shares are bought up. When they do buy, imagine all those shares being bought at premium price.

Upvote so everyone sees!!!

My fellow retards, the drops are manufactured. The shorts are flexing their last billion dollar by shorting even more!!! This act will push the price down significantly because they are doing Naked shorts. (Its a thing). 
Which means, as soon as they open the GME and BB to buy again, the price will shoot back up. 

Also, regardless, this Friday there is a massive Gamma squeeze coming in.. so it will go above yesterday close for sure. 

Hold on to your pants... don’t be scared by the drops. The mathematics of a short squeeze don’t lie. The new shorts, mean an even higher price above our initial $1000 estimates. Those who hold will be rewarded. Fuck yeah! Lets go!

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions?

It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",2021-01-29

File a complaint with the SEC, this is straight up manipulation: [Link here](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)

&#x200B;

Robinhood Financial LLC, 85 WILLOW ROAD MENLO PARK, CA  94025 

&#x200B;

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced multiple stocks including NOK, AMC, BB, GME to be driven down after hours. Further more, searching the platform for ANY symbol has been disabled, and during critical periods the platform is unavailable. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

&#x200B;

Robinhood has suddenly change the rules under the guise of ""protecting"" us when in reality they are directly affecting the outcomes of positions in which I and many others hold stake during a critical period, and by extension putting retail investors at heightened risk, and the only ones standing to benefit from this are the hedge funds with the most to lose on their short positions.

&#x200B;

I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.",2021-01-28

EDIT: 01/29/2021
still holding. nothing about this company has fundementally changed other than hedge funds manipulating the buying pressure. If the only option is to sell of course it will drop. This is not a natural drop, its been manipulated by hedge funds to try to drop the price to cover their shorts. 
Look at how many shares are being shorted and at what price here. They want to drop the price because they are going to lose a TON of money offloading the shorts right now. 

If the price keeps going up they will have no choice but to buy the premium or risk getting margin called when all the available shares are bought up. When they do buy, imagine all those shares being bought at premium price.

13877,13877,gkx68bb,1611758346.0,"ELI5: How Shorts Work
  
Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren’t really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
“Well, this is too expensive!”, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  “I simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.”
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
“Excuse me, good sir? Don’t you want to buy this game? It’s all the rage!” He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he’d only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn’t too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When’s the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn’t happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn’t worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn’t owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn’t count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn’t worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that’s when he realized. It’s not about the game. It’s about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",2021-01-27

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

**Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!**

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the fund that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

**READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!**

**EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!**

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is **""Days to Cover""** or **""Short Ratio""** .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? **You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""**

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, **it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.**

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning **if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!** So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. **No need to panic sell.** No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the **short ratio.** If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, **NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? **$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.** If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

I have over 6 figures in the bank from the sale of my house, I’m renting now as I’m going to build my own place over the next few years. 

I decided to take a small chunk and bought into GME on Monday at $90. I bought more at at $250, much to the absolute disgust of my wife. At that point, I’d bought all I could with the cash I could get into trading accounts. 

I woke up early this morning to discover my TD account funded overnight and immediately bought more, at over $400......I haven’t got around to discussing this one with my wife yet! 

At the outset, I was honestly going to be happy making a few thousand bucks, and I went into it eyes wide open that it was a gamble.

However, immediately after I bought the last amount, the fuckery began. I’ve been raging all day and the chances of me selling now are absolute fucking zero.

I want to watch these motherfuckers squirm and suffer as the price goes into orbit. I’m a stubborn and  militant bastard at the best of times, but today I went nuclear.

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

18285,18285,gkzjruj,1611803401.0,"Keep two things in mind:

1. GME took off the last 90 minutes of the day yesterday after being flat for a couple hours.

2. Even if GME **doesn't** take off, we are up **120%** already today, and judging from the price action today, **no shorts have covered their positions today**. Today is a HUGE win do far, even if we close at the current price.

Also, it looks like there were a few short attacks today - once in pre-market after the false news story and a couple other times throughout the morning. In all instances, the price went back almost immediately.

The short positions are in a far worse position today than they were yesterday. On top of that, for the third day in a row, **every single call option available is in the money**. After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

I am not selling any positions at all this week - I will be holding my shares and calls until late Friday at which point I plan to sell part of my call position in order to execute the rest into shares. By holding out, they've locked this in through mid next week minimum. 

This is my opinion, and not financial advice in any way. This is a speculative play not based on any fundamental valuation, and I personally am fully aware of an accept the risk associated with my investment.",2021-01-27

Also From [u/buntafujiwara85](https://www.reddit.com/u/buntafujiwara85/) and [u/ShadowZpeak](https://www.reddit.com/u/ShadowZpeak/):

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically, the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have an auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thank me later.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

Please upvote this or at least spread the message.

MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKD🚨 It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks with us.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

P. S. 

Based on recent patent registrations by BB, they re doubling down on smart cities... V2X patent (vehicle to everything) was secured in December 2020, they also filed for other similar patents...

So, in short.. they are providing top notch cybersecurity to gov/armies/banks/fortune 500 companies/etc... they have already secured majority of top engine car manufacturers with 175 million of cars already on the roads and 19/25 of EV market which is like 61% of the current market using their QNX system.... They partnered up with Amazon for their IVY platform which will be used by all these cars to move data around via cloud from all the sensors and surely by car insurers to provide people with better insurance rates.... And now they re securing their 💎 hold on smart cities technologies through securing of new patents?? If you are not seeing where it's going, the whole picture, and why so many are so hyped about the company then.... go back to the start of the paragraph and read it all over again until it clicks...

I was all ready to buy BB today in the dip. I think this is a great company w. a ton of potential. They took away my gains today when they decided I couldn't buy shares. Why you ask? Because I have 27 shares and you aren't allowed to buy anymore? First they said you could only have 25, then 5, now people who don't have shares can only buy 1 share. Why!!!!!!!! If the price is so fucking low then...and continues to drop.....why? Obviously there are more shares right? People are selling right? No. They are just purposely driving the price down SO THEY CAN COVER THEIR SHORT POSITIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK THEM.

We need immediate assistance from whoever the fuck cares enough and has the power to do it. SEC load up and just act like you are the $$$ FBI and roll up and shut this shit down. Do your jobs. Dont stand by twiddling your thumbs wondering how you will proceed once this shit show is over. I dont want a slap on the wrist. I want people behind bars. I want to sue. I want the world to know what Citadel, Robinhood, and the media (CNBC im extra looking at you) have been doing. Not JUST trying to manipulate us (you and me). But everyone. I am sick of it. 

You want to play dirty. You want some conflict. Fine. I won't sell. I will ammo up and only buy. I will preach. I will shout. I will scream. I will fight. I will give love to my fellow tards. I will catch up all the poor boomers on facebook who dont know any better... real quick on whats going on and give them the real story. 

If you got me against the wall then baby you are on the edge of a cliff.

Who started expanding their inventory in the last few years to include more stuff from other hobbies I enjoy like Gundam model kits and board games? Gamestop.

I have to admit at first I thought these bastards were going to get away with painting us as evil, conniving, soulless degenerates (well, that part we are) hell bent on robbing the public's money.

BUT I'm overwhelmed by the public display of support for us AND the denouncement of these Wallstreet criminals.

The world's richest man Tweeted for us. TWICE.

Politicians openly demand a review of Wallstreet.

A famous pornstar gave us direction and inspiration as we were being silenced.

People from Germany, Korea, Canada, everywhere are throwing their support! World wide unity for a single cause!

JA FUCKING RULE entered the chat! JA RULE!

I'm not an emotional person, and I do have a position in GME (for disclosure) but it truly is uplifting to see that we are not being swept away, we are being LENT a voice, we are being given an instrument to fight back.

When the price plummeted, dread set in. I thought to myself, REALLY? THEY ARE GOING TO WIN? THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY HOPE FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. Like darkness was descending, the walls were falling, and Wallstreet was coming in to finish us off. And the a dim light appeared. Then another. And suddenly, we weren't just huddling in a corner, HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, because if this went tits up, many people were going to be SERIOUISLY, perhaps, irreversibly be ruined.

Chamath it said it. What side of history do you want to be on?

The side where billionaires live to see the day where their yachts and mansions and penthouses are untouched and millions of hardworking people are BANKRUPTED?

Or one where the little guy feasts for one night and maybe rescues their entire generation?

No matter how this ends, I wanted to let everyone here know (and anyone just standing on the sidelines too) that WE DID something special. 2020 was utter crap but it lead up to this.

# When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&restrict_sr=1)

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

* Days  to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days  to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days  to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares  and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the  company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

\-  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same  thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin  Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take  alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share  movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

AMC is good due to interest by WSB investors, but the stock is over priced, some will profit some will get caught out if people start to sell at profits. 

GME is a war stock, fighting those hedge funds, for many it's not about the money it's about winning the war.

MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKD🚨 It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They  didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",2021-01-29

5) hoard shares like your life depends on it

6) tell friends, because sharing is caring.. duhh

P. S. 

Based on recent patent registrations by BB, they re doubling down on smart cities... V2X patent (vehicle to everything) was secured in December 2020, they also filed for other similar patents...

So, in short.. they are providing top notch cybersecurity to gov/armies/banks/fortune 500 companies/etc... they have already secured majority of top engine car manufacturers with 175 million of cars already on the roads and 19/25 of EV market which is like 61% of the current market using their QNX system.... They partnered up with Amazon for their IVY platform which will be used by all these cars to move data around via cloud from all the sensors and surely by car insurers to provide people with better insurance rates.... And now they re securing their 💎 hold on smart cities technologies through securing of new patents?? If you are not seeing where it's going, the whole picture, and why so many are so hyped about the company then.... go back to the start of the paragraph and read it all over again until it clicks...

# When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&restrict_sr=1)

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

* Days  to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days  to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days  to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares  and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the  company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

\-  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same  thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin  Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take  alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share  movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

28551,28551,gkx68bb,1611758346.0,"ELI5: How Shorts Work
  
Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren’t really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
“Well, this is too expensive!”, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  “I simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.”
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
“Excuse me, good sir? Don’t you want to buy this game? It’s all the rage!” He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he’d only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn’t too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When’s the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn’t happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn’t worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn’t owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn’t count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn’t worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that’s when he realized. It’s not about the game. It’s about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",2021-01-27

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

#IN RETARD SPEAK - THESE GUYS ARE TAKING ACTIVE AND DECEITFUL MEASURES TODAY TO GET OUT BEFORE THE BOMB THAT IS GOING TO HIT AT MARKET CLOSE TODAY.  DO NOT BE FUCKING DUPED.

29033,29033,gkzjruj,1611803401.0,"Keep two things in mind:

1. GME took off the last 90 minutes of the day yesterday after being flat for a couple hours.

2. Even if GME **doesn't** take off, we are up **120%** already today, and judging from the price action today, **no shorts have covered their positions today**. Today is a HUGE win do far, even if we close at the current price.

Also, it looks like there were a few short attacks today - once in pre-market after the false news story and a couple other times throughout the morning. In all instances, the price went back almost immediately.

The short positions are in a far worse position today than they were yesterday. On top of that, for the third day in a row, **every single call option available is in the money**. After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

I am not selling any positions at all this week - I will be holding my shares and calls until late Friday at which point I plan to sell part of my call position in order to execute the rest into shares. By holding out, they've locked this in through mid next week minimum. 

This is my opinion, and not financial advice in any way. This is a speculative play not based on any fundamental valuation, and I personally am fully aware of an accept the risk associated with my investment.",2021-01-27

A reminder to newbies, all these post saying, ""bought 500 GME, 500 AMC, 500 BB. Lets go!"" ""GME + BB 💪🏻🔥"" are shill accounts (look at how many of them joined today and have no other post history...).

They are just trying to get you to divert at least some of your funds from GME to AMC/BB/NOK/etc. Don't fall for this! I know this is going to get buried in this thread, but don't fall for it.

Also From [u/buntafujiwara85](https://www.reddit.com/u/buntafujiwara85/) and [u/ShadowZpeak](https://www.reddit.com/u/ShadowZpeak/):

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically, the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have an auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thank me later.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

I have over 6 figures in the bank from the sale of my house, I’m renting now as I’m going to build my own place over the next few years. 

I decided to take a small chunk and bought into GME on Monday at $90. I bought more at at $250, much to the absolute disgust of my wife. At that point, I’d bought all I could with the cash I could get into trading accounts. 

I woke up early this morning to discover my TD account funded overnight and immediately bought more, at over $400......I haven’t got around to discussing this one with my wife yet! 

At the outset, I was honestly going to be happy making a few thousand bucks, and I went into it eyes wide open that it was a gamble.

However, immediately after I bought the last amount, the fuckery began. I’ve been raging all day and the chances of me selling now are absolute fucking zero.

I want to watch these motherfuckers squirm and suffer as the price goes into orbit. I’m a stubborn and  militant bastard at the best of times, but today I went nuclear.

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —>  price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•  ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •  ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•  ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

If we retailers also hold and if the price goes back up to 30 or so, we might be able to trigger a mini squeeze.  Any squeeze definitely will not be in the magnitude of GME or AMC, but BB is a different beast as it has a lot more long term potential.  Feel much more comfortable buying and holding this than GME, but I am still holding GME.

One potential good catalyst is if GME / AMC resolves and people take profits, people here will want something to roll their profits into.  BB is one of the stocks on WSB and can be seen as a lot more stable, so it might be a boon for all of us.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1⁠⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2⁠⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3⁠⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4⁠⁠Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5⁠⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6⁠⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7⁠⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",2021-01-29

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.  💎  🙌",2021-01-29

File a complaint with the SEC, this is straight up manipulation: [Link here](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)

Robinhood Financial LLC, 85 WILLOW ROAD MENLO PARK, CA  94025 

&#x200B;

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced multiple stocks including NOK, AMC, BB, GME to be driven down after hours. Further more, searching the platform for ANY symbol has been disabled, and during critical periods the platform is unavailable. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

&#x200B;

Robinhood has suddenly change the rules under the guise of ""protecting"" us when in reality they are directly affecting the outcomes of positions in which I and many others hold stake during a critical period, and by extension putting retail investors at heightened risk, and the only ones standing to benefit from this are the hedge funds with the most to lose on their short positions.

&#x200B;

I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.",2021-01-28

33084,33084,gl1ozts,1611835509.0,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

REMOVE YOUR LIMITS, WE'RE GOING $2000+ KEEP THE MOMENTUM UP TARDS

This isn't financial advice, I really like the stock

33342,33342,gkzzzsd,1611810210.0,"After a week of holding, the prices are spiking just as they did every day before. This Friday feels like the beginning of your life. Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $6904.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood. Now your wife has to rub your girlfriend's feet.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.

I accept offerings to keep the church of $GMEhalla going in the form of stonks, stocks, stocks people like, tendies, stocks we like, nudes, and replies that include ""I appreciate that you are not giving me financial advice.""",2021-01-27

LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT SELL TODAY. OR ANY DAY THIS WEEK. Drops are coming. They are counting on fear to beat us. It’s the only weapon they have, but it won’t work because we are retarded. The people are finally taking the power back from these boomer hedge fund big money shorting douchebags - the same people who fucked everyone over in 2008 with CDOs and continue to fuck you over to this day.

We only have strength if we stay in this TOGETHER. HOLD THE LINE. THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASNT HAPPENED YET. Don’t pussy out you fucking idiots, we are going BALLS DEEP. The generation that perfected trash talk in COD lobbies takes shit from NOBODY. $10,000 IS NOT A MEME. I love you all you beautiful autistic bulls. Hang tight while we ride this thing into the FUCKING STRATOSPHERE.
