* When someone calls the whistleblower a liar/traitor, make a pirate arrrgh and sip

* When anyone uses a whataboutism, stand up, spin around 360, and consume

* If anyone mentions ""fake news"", smack your forehead and say ""duh"", then imbibe

* If anyone mentions Giuliani, take the little green man off your glass, then take a glug

* Put your thumb on the table anytime someone says ""witch hunt:, and the last person to do so takes one

Edit: holy shit, you all have been the nicest, most supportive people! I appreciate every single one of you for that. I'll give a general answer to a lot of questions then respond to everybody individually. Yes, I'm doing a lot better. I do still drink, but a lot less than I used to. Now, a 12 pack would take me a couple of days. Used to be a couple of hours. 

Once again, please be safe with alcohol. Just because it's legal doesn't always make it a good decision.

DOUBLE EDIT!!! If someone you care about is an alcoholic, try to reach out to them. Sometimes we don't realize how bad we are until the people we love most desert us, which usually leads to an even worse cycle of abuse. If you are an alcoholic and want to stop or at least slow down, my best advice is to find someone else who is and also wants to improve themselves. Actively listen to them when they share their feelings, and expect the same from them when you share yours. It's not easy, but who ever said that improving your life was?

AA can work for some, group settings can work for some, other options can work for some. Find what works best for you. Will you fail? Most likely. I did several times. I'm still not fully sober. But that first step and COMMITMENT to it is the most important part.

227,f6xv3xc,t1_f6xtemw,"Donald Trump withheld military aid that had been guaranteed to Ukraine, one of our international allies. He told the Ukrainian President the aid would come if he agreed to publically announce that he was investigating the Bidens and the previous Ukranian administration's ""attempts to collude with the DNC and attack the 2016 election."" That last bit is a conspiracy theory floated by Paul Manafort back in 2016 before the election that for some reason the DNC colluded with Ukraine to hack and release their own emails. Because reasons.

A foreign intelligence official in the white house heard about all this and was concerned and filed a whistleblower complaint. That complaint got held up and Congress was not notified, which legally they should have been. The whistleblower then reached out to Congress to ask ""Hey, I filed a complaint and it should have been given to you by now. Do you know about this?"" Congress did not know, as the complaint was being held up by White House officials installed by Trump. Once news gets out that there is a complaint, Trump tries to get ahead of the story and released a memorandum of the phone call to prove ""there is no quid pro quo, there is nothing wrong with this phone call."" 

When you read that memo, it becomes clear there in fact is something wrong. By all appearances, the President of the United States was extorting a foreign government for personal gain and political advantage. He was trying to get Ukraine to manufacture a scandal that would damage one of his leading political rivals. That prompted the Democrats in the house to investigate just how deep this abuse of power goes pursuant to impeachment.

Trump later went on live television and told China to investigate the Bidens. The President told a foreign adversary they should investigate an American Citizen, which would happen to benefit him politically. Seems like there is a pattern at this point.",t3_dtmyxw

566,f6y7rom,t1_f6y76y8,"Not really. If you're in rural nowheres and there are no doctors of course you're waiting unless you drive somewhere, but you'd wait anyways. No hospital is going to ignore you if you need urgent care, the only thing that happens is that things that can be delayed *are* delayed.

People complaining about wait times are still alive and able to complain.",t3_dtmyxw

Admittedly having people dying at home because they can't afford to go to the hospital cuts down on the queue by at least 18,000.",t3_dtmyxw
569,f6yayub,t1_f6y76y8,I don't think it's true. For serious things here in Canada you get in rather quickly. I had a double hernia and was through my doctor within days had an ultrasound a week later and had my surgery completed within two months. That's pretty minor work though it would seem. My Aunt had surgery for breast cancer and was in for chemotherapy within a few weeks of being diagnosed.,t3_dtmyxw

I don't remember how old the person who asked was, but it could have easily been someone who had been in the field for longer - he stayed awhile and had a huge team so there were people of all ages handling his care.

I know it's not life threatening and other people have more important problems, but would I just have to deal with it for six months or so? Right now I don't want to pay to go to the doctor so I've been waiting and hoping it goes away and I'm just curious to know at what point would I get in to see a doctor with something small like this in a country with universal health care",t3_dtmyxw
